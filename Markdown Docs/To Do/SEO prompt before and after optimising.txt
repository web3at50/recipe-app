Optimised version lower donw



I want to work on the public pre auth recipes page/menu /recipes etc. Which ties in with my admin menu admin/recipe-review

The overall goal is two fold

 - Make it even better for SEO
 - Make it even better for users

We have 8 categories and I want to expand or evolve this. Maybe its tags not categories I don't know. Its two fold.  Enhance categories but then from the back of that enhance the actual recipe pages.  So the recipe pages have more front end and backned data for seo search engines and LLMs

https://validator.schema.org/
https://www.opengraph.xyz/
https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
https://platewise.xyz/sitemap.xml

etc etc

Additions can be more specific and useful and probably search intent related such as vegan recipes, vegetarian recipes, pescatarian recipes, no dairy recipes, any of the 14 allergens outlined by natasha UK law (screenshot attached).  

We need and I would like a category overhaul and expansion/rethinks to improve its solid foundation we already have . Lets think about users and what they may like.  Expand this to the recipe page then too and include all the extra info in the above formats for seo too

These would be good specific searches and also tied in with our site functionality

More you can think of too please

So these are all in the recipe page and available for sea using the above tools and lie our existing setup to be fair (please review the codebase in frontend directory and supabase directory for the wonderful foundation you and I have built already)

On the individual recipe pages I would like FAQ schema for schema.org and seo structured data for search engines and llms

It would be  good if you could assign a separate specialist agent with websearch capabilities to search for live keyword data from the likes of Google, Ahrefs, or SEMrush to validate search volume and competition. UK specific data o google.co.uk etc. This should be done first before thinking about the structure and additions above as it will give us what we are aiming to add?

I think a good summary of what I want is two fold


Task 1:

Assign an agent to find search terms in the UK market for what recipes people are searching for and how

Task 2

Re design and / or enhance our categories and recipe pages to accommodate this so that the keywords and structure and everything seo related is geared towards users search intent 


Agent first so have the live information required


Does this make sense?


This is optimised version


Project Brief: Recipe Pages & Categories SEO Enhancement

I need help improving the public recipes section (/recipes and related pages) and the admin recipe review system (/admin/recipe-review) in our recipe application codebase.

Project Context:

Frontend codebase is in the frontend directory
Database schema is in the supabase directory
We currently have 8 recipe categories
Site URL: https://platewise.xyz
We have a solid foundation already built that should be reviewed before proceeding
Overall Goals:

Enhance SEO optimization for search engines and LLMs
Improve user experience and search intent alignment
SEO Validation Tools to Consider:

https://validator.schema.org/
https://www.opengraph.xyz/
https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
Our sitemap: https://platewise.xyz/sitemap.xml
Specific Requirements:

TASK 1 - Market Research (DO THIS FIRST): Launch a specialized web search agent to research UK-specific recipe search data:

Find popular recipe search terms and patterns in the UK market (google.co.uk)
Analyze search volume and competition data
Identify user search intent patterns
Look for data from sources like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush
Focus on dietary and allergen-related searches
This research should inform all subsequent decisions.

TASK 2 - Implementation (After Task 1 completes):

Based on the research findings, enhance the following:

A. Category System Overhaul:

Review current 8-category structure
Expand/redesign to include search intent-driven categories such as:
Vegan recipes
Vegetarian recipes
Pescatarian recipes
No dairy recipes
All 14 UK allergens per Natasha's Law (see attached screenshot if provided)
Additional categories based on keyword research findings
Consider whether tags, categories, or both are optimal
Ensure categories align with actual user search patterns from Task 1
B. Recipe Page Enhancements:

Add comprehensive structured data for SEO:
Schema.org markup (especially FAQ schema)
Open Graph tags
Rich results optimization
Add frontend and backend fields to support:
Dietary classifications (vegan, vegetarian, etc.)
Allergen information (all 14 UK allergens)
Search intent-optimized metadata
Additional SEO fields identified in keyword research
Ensure all data is properly indexed for search engines and LLMs
C. Database Schema Updates:

Update Supabase schema to accommodate new category/tag structure
Add fields for allergens, dietary preferences, and SEO metadata
Ensure proper relationships between recipes, categories, and tags
Deliverables:

UK recipe search keyword research report (from specialized agent)
Updated category/taxonomy structure
Enhanced recipe page schema with FAQ and rich results support
Database migrations for new fields
Updated admin interface to manage new taxonomy and metadata
Important Notes:

Review existing codebase foundation in frontend and supabase directories before starting
All changes should maintain compatibility with existing functionality
Prioritize UK search market data (google.co.uk)
Focus on actual user search intent from real data
Please start with Task 1 (keyword research) before designing any structural changes.
