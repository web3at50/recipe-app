Exporting schema from /create-recipe to /my-recipe and beyond


Need to populate some of these on output of recipes

difficulty, tags, allergens, cooking_mode , cuisine

difficulty and cooking_mode and cuisine easy

Add dietry requirements and spice schema

allergens - ai models will populate with their knowledge from reading the ingredients (in time will use the knowledge document I create)


Change ai_model  to Balanced, Guided, Streamlined, Essential

Tags can be custom like Quick (if under 30 ins), Spicy (if hot selected), think of others. Also Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Nut Free, Egg Free
