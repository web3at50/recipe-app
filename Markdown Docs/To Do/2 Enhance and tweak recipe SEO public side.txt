Fix what can here but then maybe create prompt again to review seo setup and tweak by editing categories and targeting search terms so use tags etc - tweak or redo this prompt in this file - SEO prompt before and after optimising.txt



1: We added a hamburger for mobile on the pre auth side of the site and it has made it have a slight need for horizontal scroll which I would like to fix please. See screenshot

2: We had discussed previously as well as adding individual pages for recipes we were going to have a page or pages published which highlighted and visualised etc the functionality of producing 4 recipes in one go with four different versions. I cant see this option anywhere in my admin/recipe-review dashboard  ****this has a recipe_comparisons table in supabase and not sure why!******

Is it anywhere in C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Markdown Docs\Marketing\auto recipes and content creation\Phase_1_MVP_Implementation_Plan.md or C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Markdown Docs\Marketing\auto recipes and content creation\zFuture_Phases_Roadmap.md or maybe even already in teh codebase just not used/revealed etc


13: Are pages seo friendly for LLM.  Can we add FAQ to the recipe pages as LLM like that.  How many servings, how long to cook, vegetarian, etc etc



3: Fix supabase issues

4: Placeholder text on about us etc

5: page wider on public side

6: MOre categories like allergens and dietry requriements. How are / were the 8 categories decided upon and created and can they be added/deleted etc. Revie

7: Add facility for users to authorise their recipes to go to my admin for review

8: make public page clickable so can enlarge to read and use on mobile

9: merge with ideas on Future_Phases_Roadmap.md

10: Can AI think of imprvoements to (a) get people here and (b) engage when here.  Expanding this flow


12: Natahas law page

13: Are pages seo friendly for LLM.  Can we add FAQ to the recipe pages as LLM like that.  How many servings, how long to cook, vegetarian, etc etc

9: why seo_keywords not populated in recipes database table?

14: when signed in want to see receipes public see too ! Have that menu ? SO auth side needs sidebar ad header bar?

25 Work on prompt to generate ideas


15: Good ideas  Future_SEO_Enhancements.md
Have doc for these in folder


These looked good

Future Features Explained
⏸️ Category Settings Admin Page
What it is: A dedicated admin page (e.g., /admin/category-settings) where you manage category-level metadata beyond just images. Features it could include:
Custom Images: Upload hero images for each category (what we're building now in Phase 2)
Custom Descriptions: Override default category descriptions with SEO-optimized text
Featured Recipes: Pin 3-4 "hero" recipes to top of each category
Category SEO:
Custom meta title/description per category
Custom keywords
Schema.org markup overrides
Category Status: Enable/disable categories (hide empty ones)
Sort Order: Change the order categories appear on /recipes
Why separate page: Keeps recipe-review dashboard focused on recipes, not category management.
⏸️ WebSite Schema with Search Box
What it is: Schema.org markup that enables Google's "Search this site" feature in search results. Visual example in Google:
PlateWise - AI Recipe Manager
https://platewise.xyz
[Search PlateWise  🔍]  ← This search box appears!
Requirements:
Add WebSite schema to homepage:
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "name": "PlateWise",
  "url": "https://platewise.xyz",
  "potentialAction": {
    "@type": "SearchAction",
    "target": "https://platewise.xyz/search?q={search_term_string}",
    "query-input": "required name=search_term_string"
  }
}
Build search page: /search that accepts ?q= parameter
Search functionality: Search recipes by name, ingredients, tags
SEO Benefit:
Users can search your site directly from Google results
Increases brand visibility
Higher engagement (users find specific recipes faster)
