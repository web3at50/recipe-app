# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - MOLLUSCS

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common mollusc-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines and Allergy UK resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for mollusc-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about molluscs
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain molluscs - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What are Molluscs?

Molluscs are one of the 14 major food allergens regulated in the UK and EU. They are a diverse group of invertebrate animals that typically have soft bodies, often protected by shells.

**Types of allergic reactions:**
- **IgE-mediated allergy** (immediate allergic reaction - can be severe)
- **Anaphylaxis** (life-threatening reaction - medical emergency)
- Mollusc allergies tend towards the severe, and in the worst cases can result in fatal anaphylaxis

**Key allergen:** The main allergen in molluscs is **tropomyosin**, a muscle protein. This protein is similar to the tropomyosin found in crustaceans, which can lead to cross-reactivity.

**Important distinction:** Molluscs and crustaceans are two DIFFERENT allergen categories:
- **Molluscs** = squid, octopus, mussels, oysters, clams, scallops, snails
- **Crustaceans** = prawns, shrimp, lobster, crab, crayfish
- Some people allergic to one may react to the other due to similar proteins

For this app, treat mollusc allergy as requiring strict avoidance of all mollusc species.

## ✅ SAFE - Does Not Contain Molluscs

### Fish (Fin Fish) - Different Allergen Category

**Important:** Fish and molluscs are DIFFERENT allergens. Someone allergic to molluscs can usually eat fish (unless they also have a separate fish allergy).

**Safe fish options:**
- All fresh fish (salmon, cod, haddock, tuna, mackerel, sea bass, etc.)
- All fish fillets and steaks
- Canned fish (tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel)
- Smoked fish (salmon, mackerel, kippers)
- Fish fingers (check for cross-contamination)
- Fish cakes (check ingredients - should contain only fish, not molluscs)

**Caution:** Risk of cross-contamination at seafood counters, fishmongers, and seafood restaurants where molluscs are also handled.

---

### Crustaceans - Different Allergen Category (But May Cross-React)

**Important:** Crustaceans and molluscs are DIFFERENT allergen categories, BUT they share similar proteins (tropomyosin), so some people may react to both.

**Crustaceans include:**
- Prawns, Shrimp
- Lobster, Langoustine
- Crab (brown crab, spider crab)
- Crayfish, Crawfish
- Scampi (langoustine)

**Recommendation:** If someone is allergic to molluscs, ask if they can also tolerate crustaceans. Many people can eat one but not the other, but cross-reactivity is possible.

**Caution:** Risk of cross-contamination where both molluscs and crustaceans are prepared together.

**Common names:** Nero di seppia (Italian), pasta nera, black pasta
**Look for:** Any pasta labeled with squid ink, cuttlefish ink, or nero di seppia
**Safe alternative:** Regular pasta (without squid ink), spinach pasta (green)

---

### Escargot - UNSAFE (Snails are Molluscs)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - contains molluscs
**Explanation:** Escargot is the French word for snails. Snails are gastropod molluscs and must be avoided by those with mollusc allergies.
**Common presentation:** Escargot à la Bourguignonne (snails in garlic butter)
**Related items:** Whelks, winkles (periwinkles) - all gastropod molluscs

---

### Whelks, Winkles, Periwinkles - UNSAFE (All Molluscs)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - all are molluscs
**Explanation:** These are all gastropod molluscs (snails). In the UK, they are traditional seaside foods, often sold boiled or pickled.
**Common in UK:**
- Boiled whelks (sold at seaside stalls)
- Pickled whelks (sold in jars)
- Periwinkles/winkles (small sea snails)
**Always avoid:** If you have mollusc allergy

---

### Molluscs vs Shellfish - Different Categories
**Important:** "Shellfish" is a broad term that includes BOTH molluscs and crustaceans
**Molluscs** = squid, mussels, oysters, clams, scallops, octopus, snails
**Crustaceans** = prawns, shrimp, crab, lobster, crayfish
**Different allergens:** In UK/EU food law, these are TWO separate allergen categories
**Cross-reactivity:** Some people allergic to molluscs may also react to crustaceans (due to similar tropomyosin protein), but not everyone
**Best practice:** If someone says "shellfish allergy", clarify whether it's molluscs, crustaceans, or both

---

### Fish vs Molluscs - Different Allergens
**Status:** Fish = ✅ Usually SAFE for mollusc allergy (different allergen)
**Explanation:**
- Fish allergen = parvalbumin (muscle protein in fin fish)
- Mollusc allergen = tropomyosin (muscle protein in molluscs)
- These are DIFFERENT proteins
**Usually safe:** People allergic to molluscs can usually eat fish
**Caution:** Cross-contamination is a risk at:
- Seafood counters (shared equipment, display cases)
- Fishmongers (shared cutting boards, knives)
- Seafood restaurants (shared fryers, grills, pans)
- Fish markets

---

### Surimi (Imitation Crab) - CHECK LABELS
**Status:** ⚠️ DEPENDS - check ingredients
**Explanation:** Surimi is processed fish paste, usually made from white fish (pollack, whiting). Traditional surimi does NOT contain molluscs, BUT some brands may add mollusc extracts for flavor.
**Safe if:** Contains only fish, starch, and seasonings
**Unsafe if:** Contains mollusc extracts, oyster extract, or squid
**Action:** Always check the ingredient list carefully

---

### Cross-Contamination at Seafood Counters
**Risk:** HIGH risk of cross-contamination
**Where:**
- Fresh fish counters (same display case as mussels, scallops)
- Fishmongers (shared cutting boards, knives, scales)
- Seafood restaurants (shared cooking equipment)
- Shared fryers (calamari fried in same oil as fish)

**Recommendations for users:**
1. Ask fishmonger to clean equipment before preparing fish
2. Buy pre-packaged fish to avoid counter cross-contamination
3. Inform restaurant staff of mollusc allergy
4. Ask about dedicated fryers/grills
5. Avoid seafood restaurants if allergy is severe
6. Check that fresh fish has been stored separately from molluscs

---

### XO Sauce - MAY CONTAIN (Check Labels)
**Status:** ⚠️ OFTEN UNSAFE - check ingredients
**Explanation:** XO sauce is a spicy seafood sauce from Hong Kong cuisine. Many versions contain dried scallops and dried oysters (both molluscs).
**Common ingredients:** Dried scallops, dried oysters, dried shrimp (crustacean), chili, garlic
**Action:** Check ingredient list - if contains scallops or oysters, UNSAFE for mollusc allergy

---

### Worcestershire Sauce - USUALLY SAFE (But Check)
**Status:** ✅ Usually SAFE for molluscs
**Explanation:** Traditional Worcestershire sauce contains anchovies (fish), NOT molluscs. However, some specialty versions might include oyster extract.
**Standard ingredients:** Anchovies (fish), vinegar, tamarind, spices
**Action:** Check labels for oyster extract - standard versions should be safe for mollusc allergy (but contains fish)

---

### "May Contain" Warnings
**UK Labels:** Products processed in facilities that also handle molluscs may have warnings:
- "May contain molluscs"
- "Produced in a facility that also handles molluscs"
- "Not suitable for mollusc allergy sufferers"

**Recommendation:** For severe allergies, avoid products with these warnings. For mild allergies, discuss with doctor/allergist.

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's a mollusc species**
- Does the name refer to squid, octopus, cuttlefish, mussels, oysters, clams, scallops, snails, whelks, winkles, abalone, or any other shelled sea creature?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for molluscs

**Step 2: Check if it's a mollusc derivative**
- Does it contain oyster sauce, squid ink, cuttlefish ink, oyster extract, or seafood flavoring?
- If YES → Flag as "likely contains molluscs - check labels"

**Step 3: Check if it's a seafood dish**
- Is it a seafood soup, stew, paella, risotto, pasta dish, or Asian seafood dish?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain molluscs - please verify ingredients"

**Step 4: Check if it's fish or crustacean**
- Is it a fish (salmon, cod, tuna) or crustacean (prawn, crab, lobster)?
- If YES → Usually SAFE for molluscs (different allergen), but mention cross-contamination risk

**Step 5: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about mollusc biology and seafood composition
- Research the ingredient's typical composition

**Step 6: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain molluscs - please verify the label or contact the manufacturer"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

---

### Safety Principles for Molluscs:

1. **Oyster sauce is the #1 hidden source** - Always check Asian dishes for oyster sauce
2. **Squid ink means molluscs** - Black pasta or risotto usually contains squid/cuttlefish ink
3. **Escargot is a mollusc** - Snails are gastropod molluscs
4. **Shellfish = molluscs + crustaceans** - Clarify which type when user says "shellfish"
5. **Fish is usually safe** - Different allergen, but cross-contamination risk at seafood counters
6. **UK labels are reliable** - Molluscs must be declared and highlighted in bold
7. **Seafood restaurants are high risk** - Cross-contamination from shared equipment
8. **Tropomyosin cross-reactivity** - Some people allergic to molluscs may also react to crustaceans
