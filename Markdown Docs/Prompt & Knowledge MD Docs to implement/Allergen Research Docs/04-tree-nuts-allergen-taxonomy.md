# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - TREE NUTS

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of tree nuts and tree nut-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines, Allergy UK resources, and Anaphylaxis UK guidance. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for tree nut-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about tree nuts
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain tree nuts - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What are Tree Nuts?

Tree nuts are one of the 14 major allergens regulated in the UK. They grow on trees (unlike peanuts, which grow underground). Tree nut allergy affects approximately 2% of children and 0.5% of adults in the UK.

**Key Facts:**
- **Cross-reactivity is common** - People allergic to one tree nut are often allergic to others due to similar proteins
- **Usually lifelong** - Tree nut allergies rarely resolve, especially after age 5
- **Can be severe** - Tree nut allergies can cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction
- **Different from peanuts** - Peanuts are legumes, not tree nuts (separate allergen category)

**UK Regulations:**
Under UK food information regulations, tree nuts must be highlighted in bold or emphasized on ingredient lists. In March 2025, the FSA updated guidance requiring specific labeling (e.g., "may contain almonds" rather than generic "may contain nuts").

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's a tree nut or derivative**
- Does the name contain "almond", "walnut", "hazelnut", "cashew", "pecan", "pistachio", "macadamia", or "brazil nut"?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for tree nuts

**Step 2: Check if it's commonly confused with tree nuts**
- Is it coconut, nutmeg, water chestnut, butternut squash, or chestnut?
- If YES → It's SAFE (see Tricky Cases section)

**Step 3: Check if it's a seed**
- Is it pine nuts, sesame, sunflower, pumpkin, or other seeds?
- If YES → Usually SAFE (pine nuts - see Tricky Cases)

**Step 4: Check if it's peanuts**
- Peanuts are legumes, not tree nuts (separate allergen category)
- If ingredient is peanuts → It's safe for tree nut allergy (but not for peanut allergy!)

**Step 5: Check if it's a processed product**
- Is it pesto, marzipan, nougat, praline, dukkah, or similar?
- If YES → Flag as "likely contains tree nuts - check ingredients"

**Step 6: Check if it's a natural whole food**
- Is it a fresh vegetable, fruit, meat, fish, egg, or seed?
- If YES → Usually SAFE (unless it's a tree nut!)

**Step 7: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about tree nuts and botanical families
- Research the ingredient's typical composition if needed

**Step 8: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain tree nuts - please verify the label or consult your allergist"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

---

### Safety Principles for Tree Nuts:

1. **Always check processed foods** - Tree nuts hide in unexpected places (pesto, desserts, sauces)
2. **Don't be fooled by names** - Coconut, nutmeg, water chestnuts are NOT tree nuts
3. **Cross-reactivity matters** - Many people allergic to one tree nut react to others
4. **Peanuts are different** - Peanuts are legumes, not tree nuts (separate allergen)
5. **UK labels are reliable** - Tree nuts must be highlighted in bold on UK labels
6. **"May contain" warnings are important** - Assess risk with allergist for severe allergies
7. **Seeds are safe** - Sunflower, pumpkin, sesame, chia seeds are NOT tree nuts

### Examples of Good AI Behavior:

**Example 1: Item in Taxonomy**
```
User ingredient: "Pesto"
Taxonomy says: Contains pine nuts (usually safe but check Tricky Cases)
AI action: Flag as "traditional pesto contains pine nuts - usually safe for tree nut allergies, but check individual tolerance. Nut-free pesto alternatives available."
✅ Correct
```

**Example 2: Item in Taxonomy - Hidden Source**
```
User ingredient: "Marzipan"
Taxonomy says: Almond paste - UNSAFE
AI action: Flag allergen conflict, suggest seed-based alternatives or avoid
✅ Correct
```

**Example 3: Tricky Case - Coconut**
```
User ingredient: "Coconut milk"
Taxonomy: Listed as SAFE (despite name)
AI action: Allow coconut milk, don't flag as tree nut allergen
✅ Correct - followed taxonomy's tricky cases section
```

**Example 4: Item NOT in Taxonomy**
```
User ingredient: "Gianduja chocolate"
Taxonomy: Not explicitly listed
AI knowledge: Gianduja is chocolate-hazelnut paste (contains hazelnuts)
AI action: Flag as UNSAFE for tree nuts even though not explicitly listed
✅ Correct - used own knowledge
```

**Example 5: Uncertain Item**
```
User ingredient: "Natural flavoring"
Taxonomy: Warns about natural nut flavorings
AI knowledge: Could be anything
AI action: Flag as "may contain tree nuts - please verify the specific flavoring source"
✅ Correct - asked for clarification rather than assuming
```

**Example 6: Peanuts (Different Allergen)**
```
User ingredient: "Peanut butter"
Taxonomy: Listed as SAFE for tree nut allergy (but separate allergen)
AI action: Don't flag for tree nut allergy, but note "Peanuts are a separate allergen - safe for tree nut allergy unless you also have peanut allergy"
✅ Correct - distinguished between tree nuts and peanuts
```

**Example 7: Pine Nuts (Tricky Case)**
```
User ingredient: "Homemade pesto with pine nuts"
Taxonomy: Pine nuts in Tricky Cases - usually safe but individual advice needed
AI action: Note "Pine nuts are generally safe for tree nut allergies (they're seeds, not nuts), but individual tolerance varies. Check with your allergist if uncertain."
✅ Correct - provided nuanced guidance from Tricky Cases
```
