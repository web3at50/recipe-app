# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - PEANUTS

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common peanut-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines, Allergy UK, and Anaphylaxis UK resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for peanut-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about peanut-containing foods
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain peanuts - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious
6. **Remember the mustard contamination alert** → FSA has advised peanut-allergic individuals to avoid foods containing mustard due to contamination from an Indian producer

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Peanut Allergy?

Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies and a leading cause of anaphylaxis in the UK. Important facts:

- **Peanuts are LEGUMES** (in the same plant family as peas, beans, and lentils), **NOT tree nuts**
- Affects approximately **1 in 50 children** and **1 in 200 adults** in the UK
- Can cause severe allergic reactions, including life-threatening **anaphylaxis**
- Reactions can be triggered by **tiny amounts** (a fragment of peanut is enough)
- Peanut allergy is one of the **14 major allergens** that must be declared on UK food labels
- **30-40% of children** with peanut allergy may also have tree nut allergies, but they are **separate allergens**

**Alternative Names for Peanuts:**
- Groundnut
- Monkey nuts
- Arachis (scientific name: Arachis hypogaea)
- Beer nuts (when roasted and salted)
- Goober nuts

For this app, treat all peanut exposure as requiring strict avoidance.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Peanuts vs Tree Nuts - DIFFERENT ALLERGENS

**Status:** ⚠️ DIFFERENT allergens - separate plant families

**Explanation:**
- **Peanuts** = Legumes (family: Fabaceae) - related to peas, beans, lentils
- **Tree nuts** = Various botanical families - almonds, walnuts, cashews, hazelnuts, etc.
- These are **completely different plant families**
- A peanut allergy does NOT automatically mean tree nut allergy

**However:**
- **30-40% of children** with peanut allergy also have tree nut allergies
- This is called **co-allergy** or **cross-reactivity**
- Always verify with allergy testing before assuming tree nuts are safe
- If uncertain, avoid both peanuts AND tree nuts

**UK Labeling:**
- Peanuts and tree nuts are **separate allergens** in the UK's 14 major allergens
- Labels must specify "peanuts" AND "tree nuts" separately
- Generic "may contain nuts" is discouraged - labels should specify "may contain peanuts" or "may contain tree nuts"

---

### Refined Peanut Oil - CONTROVERSIAL

**Status:** ⚠️ Likely safe for most, but MUST be declared on UK labels

**The Science:**
- A landmark 1997 Southampton study tested 60 peanut-allergic individuals
- **NONE reacted to refined peanut oil**
- 10% reacted to crude/unrefined peanut oil
- Refined oils contain **no detectable protein** (allergens are proteins)
- Crude "gourmet" oils retain flavor and **may contain protein**

**The UK/EU Regulation:**
- Despite evidence, **peanut oil MUST be declared** on labels (refined or unrefined)
- This is different from the US FDA, which exempts highly refined oils
- EFSA assessment determined peanut oil must always be declared

**Recommendation:**
- **Refined peanut oil** is likely safe for the overwhelming majority of peanut-allergic people
- **Unrefined/crude/cold-pressed peanut oil** is UNSAFE
- It's up to individuals/parents to weigh the evidence and decide
- If uncertain, avoid all peanut oil

**How to Identify:**
- "Refined peanut oil" or "highly refined peanut oil" = likely safe
- "Cold-pressed peanut oil," "gourmet peanut oil," "crude peanut oil," or just "arachis oil" = UNSAFE

---

### Peanuts and Other Legumes - USUALLY SAFE

**Status:** ✅ Most people with peanut allergy can eat other legumes

**Explanation:**
- Peanuts are legumes (like peas, beans, lentils, soybeans)
- However, **most people with peanut allergy can safely eat other legumes**
- The proteins in peanuts are different from those in other legumes
- Cross-reactivity is rare but possible

**Safe for Most:**
- Chickpeas, lentils, peas, beans, soybeans (edamame, tofu)
- Hummus (chickpea-based)
- Soy milk, soy sauce (if no soy allergy)

**Exception - Lupin:**
- Lupin is a legume that shows **higher cross-reactivity** with peanuts
- Lupin is one of the UK's 14 major allergens
- Some people with peanut allergy may react to lupin
- Check labels for lupin flour (used in some European baked goods)

**Recommendation:**
- Most peanut-allergic individuals can eat other legumes safely
- Introduce cautiously if uncertain
- Consult an allergist if you have concerns

---

### Sesame and Peanuts - POSSIBLE OVERLAP

**Status:** ⚠️ Some overlap in allergies

**Explanation:**
- Research suggests allergies to sesame seeds and peanuts may overlap
- Sesame is one of the UK's 14 major allergens (added in 2021)
- If you have peanut allergy, be cautious with tahini (sesame seed butter)

**Recommendation:**
- If you have peanut allergy, verify you can tolerate sesame before consuming tahini
- Watch for symptoms when trying sesame products for the first time
- Sesame is found in: tahini, hummus (some brands), bread toppings, halva, some sauces

---

### Mustard Contamination - URGENT FSA ALERT (2025)

**Status:** ❌ AVOID mustard if you have peanut allergy (as of 2025)

**Explanation:**
- The FSA has issued urgent advice for peanut-allergic individuals to **avoid all products containing mustard, mustard powder, or mustard flour**
- Contamination discovered from a producer in India
- This is an **active food safety issue**

**Products to Avoid:**
- Mustard (condiment)

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's a peanut derivative**
- Does the name contain "peanut," "groundnut," "arachis," "goober," or "monkey nut"?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for peanut allergy

**Step 2: Check if it's Asian/African cuisine**
- Is it a Thai, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, or West African dish or sauce?
- Does it mention "satay," "peanut sauce," "groundnut," or "maafe"?
- If YES → Flag as HIGH RISK, likely contains peanuts

**Step 3: Check if it's a processed product**
- Is it chocolate, confectionery, cereal bar, ice cream, sauce, or baked good?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain peanuts - check labels"

**Step 4: Check if it's a tree nut or seed product**
- Is it a tree nut butter (almond, cashew, etc.) or seed butter (sunflower, tahini)?
- If YES → Usually SAFE for peanut allergy BUT verify no tree nut/seed cross-allergies

**Step 5: Check if it's another legume**
- Is it chickpeas, lentils, beans, peas, soybeans?
- If YES → Usually SAFE for peanut allergy (except lupin - higher risk)

**Step 6: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about food chemistry and peanut usage
- Consider regional cuisines that commonly use peanuts

**Step 7: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain peanuts - please verify the label or choose a certified peanut-free version"
- Better to be cautious than risk anaphylaxis

---

### Safety Principles for Peanuts:

1. **Peanut allergy is severe** - Tiny amounts can trigger anaphylaxis
2. **Asian and African cuisines are high-risk** - Peanuts are heavily used
3. **Peanuts ≠ Tree nuts** - Different allergens, different plant families
4. **30-40% co-allergy with tree nuts** - Many peanut-allergic people also react to tree nuts
5. **"May contain" warnings matter** - Cross-contamination is a real risk
6. **Takeaway food is high-risk** - Studies show high contamination rates
7. **Check labels always** - Peanuts hide in unexpected products
8. **Refined oil debate** - Likely safe but personal decision
9. **Mustard contamination alert** - FSA warning active as of 2025
10. **UK labels are reliable** - Peanuts must be declared and highlighted
