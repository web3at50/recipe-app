# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - SHELLFISH/CRUSTACEANS

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common crustacean-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines, Allergy UK, and NHS resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for crustacean/shellfish-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about crustacean-based foods
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain crustaceans - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What are Crustaceans?

Crustaceans are shellfish with segmented bodies, jointed legs, and hard exoskeletons. They are one of the 14 major allergens regulated by the UK Food Standards Agency and must be clearly labeled on all food products.

**Common crustaceans include:**
- Prawns, Shrimp
- Crab
- Lobster
- Crayfish, Crawfish
- Langoustine (Dublin Bay Prawns, Scampi)
- Krill

**Allergen protein:** Tropomyosin is the main allergenic protein in crustaceans, causing reactions in over 60% of shellfish-allergic patients.

**Important:** Crustacean allergies are typically lifelong and rarely outgrown. Reactions can be severe and may occur from eating, touching, or inhaling cooking vapors.

**Note:** In the UK, "shellfish" refers to both:
- **Crustaceans** (prawns, crab, lobster) - covered in this document
- **Molluscs** (mussels, oysters, clams) - separate allergen (see separate taxonomy)

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Crustaceans vs Molluscs - Related But SEPARATE Allergens

**Status:** ⚠️ SEPARATE allergens in UK law, BUT can cross-react

**The Key Difference:**
- **Crustaceans:** Hard segmented shell, jointed legs (prawns, crab, lobster)
- **Molluscs:** Soft body, often in one shell or no shell (mussels, oysters, squid)

**UK Law:** Both must be declared separately on food labels
- "Contains: Crustaceans"
- "Contains: Molluscs"

**Cross-Reactivity:**
- Both contain tropomyosin (same allergenic protein)
- Up to 75% of crustacean-allergic people also react to molluscs
- 25% can safely eat molluscs despite crustacean allergy
- Some people are allergic to molluscs but not crustaceans

**For This App:**
If user has crustacean allergy:
- FLAG mollusc-containing recipes as "potential cross-reactivity risk"
- Suggest checking with allergist before trying molluscs
- Don't automatically exclude molluscs, but WARN user

**Examples:**
- Prawns (crustacean) vs Mussels (mollusc)
- Crab (crustacean) vs Oysters (mollusc)
- Lobster (crustacean) vs Squid/Calamari (mollusc)

---

### Prawn Crackers - ALWAYS Contain Shrimp

**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - contains crustaceans

**Explanation:** Despite being called "crackers," prawn crackers (krupuk udang) ALWAYS contain real shrimp or prawns. They are made from tapioca starch mixed with ground shrimp.

**Common Misconception:** "It's just the flavor" - NO, they contain real shrimp!

**UK Availability:**
- Chinese restaurants and takeaways
- Supermarkets (Asian food aisles)
- Some fish and chip shops

**Alternative:** Plain prawn crackers do not exist - look for plain rice crackers or vegetable crackers instead.

---

### Fish Sauce - OFTEN Contains Shrimp

**Status:** ⚠️ OFTEN UNSAFE - frequently contains shrimp/prawns

**Explanation:** Traditional fish sauce (nam pla, nuoc mam) is made by fermenting fish. However, many brands also include shrimp or prawns in the fermentation process.

**UK Products:**
- Some Thai and Vietnamese fish sauce brands contain shrimp
- Must be declared on label in UK ("Contains: Fish, Crustaceans")
- Vegetarian/vegan fish sauce is safe (made from soy or mushrooms)

**Always check labels:** Even if the main ingredient is fish, shrimp may be added.

**Safe Alternatives:**
- Soy sauce (check it's just soy and wheat)
- Coconut aminos
- Vegan fish sauce (mushroom-based)

---

### Prawn/Seafood Flavored Crisps - USUALLY Safe

**Status:** ✅ USUALLY SAFE (but check labels)

**Explanation:** Most "prawn cocktail" flavored crisps in the UK do NOT contain real prawns - they use artificial flavorings.

**UK Examples:**
- Walkers Prawn Cocktail - Usually safe (artificial flavor)
- Skips Prawn Cocktail - Usually safe (artificial flavor)

**BUT:**
- Always check the allergen label
- Some premium or Asian-style crisps may contain real shrimp powder
- If label says "Contains: Crustaceans" → UNSAFE

**How to check:** Look at allergen box on pack:
- If no crustacean warning → Usually safe
- If says "Contains: Crustaceans" → UNSAFE

---

### Glucosamine Supplements - Often Shellfish-Derived

**Status:** ⚠️ OFTEN UNSAFE - usually derived from crustacean shells

**Explanation:** Glucosamine supplements (used for joint health) are typically made from the shells of shrimp, crab, or lobster.

**UK Guidance:**
- Allergy UK advises avoiding glucosamine if shellfish-allergic
- UK licensed brands (Alateris, Dolenio, Glusartel, YOINTY) contraindicate use in shellfish allergy
- May contain trace proteins despite being from shells (not flesh)

**Scientific Note:**
- Shellfish allergy is typically to flesh proteins, not shell
- However, cross-contamination can occur during processing
- Risk cannot be completely ruled out

**Safe Alternatives:**
- Shellfish-free glucosamine (made from fermented corn or fungi)
- Look for "suitable for shellfish allergy" on label
- Plant-based joint supplements

**Recommendation:** Avoid unless specifically labeled "shellfish-free"

---

### Crab Sticks (Surimi) - COMPLICATED

**Status:** ⚠️ CHECK CAREFULLY - may or may not contain crab

**Explanation:** "Crab sticks" or "seafood sticks" are made from surimi (processed fish paste), usually pollock or cod. They are typically flavored to taste like crab.

**UK Products:**
- Most UK crab sticks do NOT contain real crab (just fish)
- However, some premium brands add real crab extract for flavor
- Must be declared on label if contains crustaceans

**How to check:**
- Read allergen box: "Contains: Fish" only → Safe (no crab)
- Read allergen box: "Contains: Fish, Crustaceans" → UNSAFE (contains crab)

**Note:** Even if safe from crustaceans, crab sticks contain fish (separate allergen).

---

### Asian Sauces and Pastes - High Risk for Hidden Shellfish

**Status:** ⚠️ OFTEN UNSAFE - frequently contain shrimp paste

**Explanation:** Many Asian sauces, curry pastes, and condiments contain shrimp paste (belacan, terasi, kapi) as a base ingredient.

**High-Risk Products:**
- Thai curry pastes (red, green, yellow) - OFTEN contain shrimp paste
- Malaysian sambal (many varieties contain belacan)
- Indonesian bumbu (seasoning pastes)
- Some kimchi (contains salted shrimp)
- Some oyster sauce brands (may contain shrimp)

**Always Check Labels:**
- Look for "shrimp paste," "belacan," "terasi," "kapi"
- Check allergen box for "Crustaceans"
- When in doubt, ASK in restaurants

**Safe Alternatives:**
- Vegan/vegetarian Asian curry pastes (specify no shrimp paste)
- Make your own curry paste from scratch
- Japanese miso paste (soy-based, no shellfish)

---

### Shared Equipment and Cross-Contamination

**High-Risk Situations:**

**Fish Markets and Counters:**
- Shared cutting boards, knives, scales
- Crustacean juices can contaminate fish
- Ask for thoroughly cleaned equipment

**Shared Fryers:**
- Chips/fries cooked in same oil as scampi/prawns
- Battered fish may be cooked with battered prawns
- Fish and chip shops - ASK about separate fryers

**Asian Restaurants:**
- Shrimp paste used in many dishes (even vegetable dishes)
- Shared woks and cooking utensils
- Cross-contamination risk is HIGH

**Seafood Restaurants:**
- Shared grills, pans, cooking surfaces
- Airborne proteins from steaming shellfish
- High cross-contamination risk

**For This App:**
If user has severe crustacean allergy:
- Warn about cross-contamination risks
- Suggest dedicated cooking equipment
- Advise caution in seafood restaurants

---

### Chitin and Chitosan - Derived from Crustacean Shells

**Status:** ⚠️ UNSAFE - derived from shellfish shells

**Explanation:** Chitin and chitosan are derived from the shells of crustaceans (mainly shrimp, crab). They are used in dietary supplements, cosmetics, and some food products.

**Uses:**
- Dietary fiber supplements
- Weight loss supplements
- Wound dressings (medical)
- Some cosmetics
- Food preservatives (rarely)

**UK Labeling:**
- Must be declared if used in food products
- Check supplement labels carefully

**Allergy Risk:**
- Similar to glucosamine - risk is debated
- May contain trace proteins from processing
- Allergists typically recommend avoidance

**Recommendation:** Avoid unless confirmed safe by allergist

---

### "Seafood" - Ambiguous Term

**Status:** ⚠️ CLARIFY - could mean fish, crustaceans, molluscs, or all

**Explanation:** "Seafood" is not specific enough. It can refer to:
- Fish only
- Crustaceans only
- Molluscs only
- All of the above

**In Recipes:**
- "Seafood stock" - Could contain any combination
- "Seafood mix" - Usually contains crustaceans and molluscs
- "Seafood sauce" - Check ingredients

**UK Labeling:**
- Allergen labels must specify: "Fish," "Crustaceans," or "Molluscs"
- Generic "seafood" is not sufficient for allergen declaration

**For This App:**
When you see "seafood" without specification:
- FLAG as "may contain crustaceans - please specify exact ingredients"
- Ask user to clarify what type of seafood
- Better to be cautious

---

### Cooking Vapors and Airborne Exposure

**Status:** ⚠️ CAUTION - can trigger reactions in some people

**Explanation:** Some highly sensitive individuals may react to airborne proteins released when shellfish is cooked (steaming, boiling, frying).

**Where This Occurs:**
- Home cooking (boiling prawns, steaming crab)
- Fish markets (fresh shellfish)
- Seafood restaurants (cooking shellfish nearby)
- Asian restaurants (wok cooking with shrimp paste)

**Symptoms:**
- Respiratory symptoms (wheezing, coughing)
- Skin reactions (hives, itching)
- Eye irritation
- In severe cases, anaphylaxis

**Recommendation for Severe Allergy:**
- Avoid being in the kitchen when shellfish is cooking
- Avoid fish markets and seafood counters
- Be cautious in seafood restaurants (inform staff)
- Ensure good ventilation if others cook shellfish at home

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's a crustacean or derivative**
- Does the name contain "prawn," "shrimp," "crab," "lobster," "crayfish," "langoustine," "scampi," or "krill"?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for crustacean allergy

**Step 2: Check if it's an Asian ingredient**
- Is it a paste, sauce, or condiment from Asian cuisine?
- Could it contain shrimp paste or dried shrimp?
- If POSSIBLE → Flag as "may contain crustaceans - check label for shrimp paste"

**Step 3: Check if it's a "seafood" product**
- Does it say "seafood stock," "seafood flavoring," or "shellfish extract"?
- If YES → Flag as "likely contains crustaceans - verify ingredients"

**Step 4: Check if it's a supplement**
- Is it glucosamine, chitin, chitosan, or "marine collagen"?
- If YES → Flag as "often shellfish-derived - check label"

**Step 5: Check if it's mollusc-based**
- Is it oysters, mussels, clams, squid, octopus, scallops?
- If YES → Flag as "mollusc (separate allergen) - potential cross-reactivity with crustaceans"

**Step 6: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about food composition and processing
- Research the ingredient's typical source

**Step 7: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain crustaceans - please verify the label or check with manufacturer"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

---

### Safety Principles for Crustacean Allergy:

1. **Always check Asian ingredients** - Shrimp paste hides in many sauces and curry pastes
2. **Prawn crackers ALWAYS contain shrimp** - No exceptions
3. **Fish sauce often contains shrimp** - Check every label
4. **Molluscs are separate but related** - 75% cross-reactivity rate
5. **Glucosamine is usually shellfish-derived** - Avoid unless labeled shellfish-free
6. **Cross-contamination is common** - Shared fryers, fish counters, Asian restaurants
7. **UK labels are reliable** - Crustaceans must be declared
8. **"Seafood" is too vague** - Always ask for specifics

---

### Examples of Good AI Behavior:

**Example 1: Item in Taxonomy**
```
User ingredient: "Prawn crackers"
Taxonomy says: ALWAYS contain shrimp - UNSAFE
AI action: Flag allergen conflict, explain they contain real shrimp despite being crackers
✅ Correct
```

**Example 2: Item NOT in Taxonomy**
```
User ingredient: "Thai red curry paste"
Taxonomy: Not specifically listed, but Asian sauces section mentions curry pastes often contain shrimp paste
AI action: Flag as "likely contains shrimp paste - check label for crustaceans"
✅ Correct - applied taxonomy knowledge
```

**Example 3: Uncertain Item**
```
User ingredient: "Seafood stock"
Taxonomy: Not specific enough
AI knowledge: Could contain crustaceans, molluscs, or fish
AI action: Flag as "may contain crustaceans - please specify if it contains prawns, crab, or lobster"
✅ Correct - asked for clarification
```

**Example 4: False Positive Avoided**
```
User ingredient: "Prawn cocktail crisps (Walkers)"
Taxonomy: Lists these as usually safe (artificial flavor)
AI action: Check label - if no crustacean warning, approve. If uncertain, flag to check allergen box.
✅ Correct - followed taxonomy's tricky cases section
```

**Example 5: Cross-Reactivity Handling**
```
User has crustacean allergy, recipe contains mussels
Taxonomy: Molluscs are separate allergen but 75% cross-reactivity
AI action: FLAG as "Contains molluscs - separate allergen but may cross-react with crustacean allergy (affects 75% of people). Check with allergist before consuming."
✅ Correct - warned about cross-reactivity without automatically excluding
```

**Example 6: Glucosamine**
```
User ingredient: "Glucosamine supplement"
Taxonomy: Usually shellfish-derived
AI action: Flag as "typically derived from crustacean shells - avoid unless labeled 'shellfish-free'"
✅ Correct - followed supplement guidance
```
