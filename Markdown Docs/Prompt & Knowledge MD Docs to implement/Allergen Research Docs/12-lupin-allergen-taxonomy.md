# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - LUPIN

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of lupin-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines, Allergy UK, and Anaphylaxis UK resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for lupin-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about lupin and legumes
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain lupin - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious
6. **Important:** People with peanut allergy have 5-37% risk of cross-reactivity with lupin - always mention this connection

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Lupin?

Lupin (also spelled "lupine") is a legume from the same family as peanuts, soybeans, and other beans. The seeds of the lupin plant are crushed to make lupin flour, which is used in various food products.

**Key Facts:**
- **One of the 14 major allergens** regulated in the UK (must be declared on labels)
- **More common in Europe** (especially France, Italy, and Mediterranean countries) than in the UK
- **Used as a gluten-free alternative** - increasingly found in gluten-free products
- **High in protein** - used in vegan and vegetarian products
- **Cross-reactivity with peanuts** - 5-37% of people with peanut allergy may also react to lupin
- **Rising prevalence** - In France, lupin became the 4th most frequent cause of severe food anaphylaxis by 2002

**Types of Reactions:**
- IgE-mediated food allergy (immediate allergic reaction)
- Can cause severe anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals
- Cross-reactions possible in those with peanut allergy (both are legumes)

For this app, treat lupin allergy as requiring strict lupin avoidance, and always flag the peanut connection.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Peanut Allergy Connection - CRITICAL
**Status:** ⚠️ HIGH RISK if you have peanut allergy
**Explanation:** Lupin is a legume in the same family as peanuts. Studies show 5-37% of people with peanut allergy also react to lupin due to similar proteins (cross-reactivity).
**Allergen proteins:** Lupin proteins are structurally similar to peanut proteins (Ara h 1, Ara h 3, Ara h 8).
**Important:** This is NOT automatic - most people with peanut allergy don't react to lupin, but the risk is significant enough to warrant caution.

**For This App:**
- If user has peanut allergy → ALWAYS warn about lupin cross-reactivity risk
- Suggest they've been tested for lupin allergy before consuming
- Recommend consulting allergist if uncertain
- DO NOT assume peanut allergy = automatic lupin allergy (only 5-37% risk)
- DO warn that the risk exists and is higher than other legumes

---

### Soy and Other Legume Cross-Reactivity - LOWER RISK
**Status:** ⚠️ POSSIBLE but less common than peanut
**Explanation:** Lupin is a legume, so there's potential for cross-reactivity with other legumes (soy, chickpeas, lentils, beans). However, cross-reactivity with other legumes is much less common than with peanuts.
**For This App:**
- If user has lupin allergy → they can usually eat other legumes safely
- However, if they have multiple legume allergies → be cautious with all legumes
- Recommend allergy testing to determine which legumes are safe

---

### Gluten-Free Products - INCREASING RISK
**Status:** ⚠️ INCREASING use of lupin in gluten-free products
**Explanation:** Lupin flour is naturally gluten-free, high in protein, and increasingly popular as a wheat substitute in gluten-free baking. This means people with coeliac disease or gluten intolerance may encounter lupin more frequently.
**Common gluten-free products with lupin:**
- Gluten-free bread (some brands)
- Gluten-free pasta (especially high-protein varieties)
- Gluten-free baked goods
- Gluten-free flour blends (some)

**For This App:**
- If user has both gluten AND peanut allergies → extra vigilant about gluten-free products
- Always check labels on gluten-free products for lupin
- Suggest UK brands that typically don't use lupin (rice/corn based)

---

### European vs UK Products - GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION
**Status:** ⚠️ MORE COMMON in European products than UK
**Explanation:** Lupin is more commonly used in France, Italy, Germany, and Mediterranean countries than in the UK. White lupin is commonly grown in Mediterranean regions.
**France:** First lupin anaphylaxis reported in 1999; by 2002, lupin was the 4th most frequent cause of severe food-associated anaphylaxis.
**UK:** Less common in UK-manufactured products, but increasing in gluten-free and health food products.

**For This App:**
- European bakery products → higher risk
- Continental pastries, bread, pasta → higher risk
- UK supermarket standard products → lower risk (but check labels)
- Imported foods from Mediterranean countries → check labels
- Health food shops → more likely to stock lupin products than mainstream shops

---

### "Lupine" vs "Lupin" - SAME THING
**Status:** ✅ Just different spellings
**Explanation:**
- "Lupin" = UK/European spelling
- "Lupine" = US spelling
- Both refer to the same allergen
- UK labels use "lupin"
- Imported US products may say "lupine"

**For This App:**
- Treat both spellings as the same allergen
- UK users will see "lupin" on labels
- Both spellings should trigger allergen warnings

---

### Keto and Low-Carb Products - INCREASING RISK
**Status:** ⚠️ FREQUENTLY contains lupin flour
**Explanation:** Lupin flour is popular in ketogenic and low-carb diets because it's low in carbohydrates and high in protein. Many keto bread, pasta, and baking products use lupin flour.
**Common keto products with lupin:**
- Keto bread and bread rolls
- Keto pasta
- Low-carb tortillas
- Keto baking mixes
- High-protein flour blends

**For This App:**
- If user mentions keto/low-carb diet AND has peanut allergy → warn about lupin
- Keto products often sold online (Amazon, specialist sites) → check labels carefully
- Mainstream UK supermarkets less likely to have lupin in keto products, but check

---

### "Lupini Beans" - WHOLE BEANS
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - contains lupin
**Explanation:** Lupini beans (Italian name) are whole lupin beans, often sold pickled or brined as a Mediterranean snack. They're a traditional antipasto in Italy and popular in Mediterranean cuisine.
**Where found:**
- Italian delis and restaurants
- Mediterranean food shops
- Continental supermarkets
- Pickled/brined snacks
- Antipasto platters

**For This App:**
- Flag "lupini beans" as containing lupin
- Warn about Mediterranean restaurants (may use lupini beans)
- Italian antipasto may contain them

---

### Vegan Protein Products - VARIABLE RISK
**Status:** ⚠️ SOME contain lupin, many don't
**Explanation:** Some vegan meat substitutes use lupin for its high protein content, but many use soy, pea protein, or mycoprotein instead.
**Lupin-containing brands:**
- Eighth Day Foods' "Lupreme" (explicitly lupin-based)
- Brami snacks (lupin beans)
- Lupii energy bars (lupin-based)
- Some continental European vegan products

**Common UK brands usually lupin-free (but check):**
- Beyond Meat (pea/soy based)
- Linda McCartney (varied - check labels)
- Quorn (mycoprotein - fungus based)
- Moving Mountains (pea based)

**For This App:**
- Check each vegan product's ingredients
- Mainstream UK supermarket vegan products usually don't contain lupin
- European/imported/health food shop vegan products → higher risk

---

### Mislabeling Risk - HIDDEN ALLERGEN
**Status:** ⚠️ Can be overlooked or mislabeled
**Explanation:** Because lupin is less well-known than peanuts or gluten, some people (and even some food businesses) may not recognize it as a major allergen. However, UK law requires lupin to be clearly labeled.
**Risks:**
- Homemade products at markets (may not know about lupin)
- Small bakeries (especially European-style)
- Restaurant dishes (may use lupin flour without realizing it's an allergen)

**For This App:**
- Always recommend asking about lupin in restaurants
- Packaged foods in UK must declare lupin by law
- Be extra cautious with homemade/craft products
