# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - SULPHITES

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common sulphite-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines, Allergy UK resources, and NHS guidance. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for sulphite-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about sulphite preservatives and E numbers E220-E228
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain sulphites - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious, especially for asthmatic users

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What are Sulphites?

Sulphites (also spelled sulfites) are a group of sulphur-based preservatives used to:
- Prevent food discolouration (especially dried fruits)
- Extend shelf life
- Prevent fungal and bacterial growth
- Stop fermentation (in wine-making)

### Who is Affected?

Sulphites can cause reactions in people with:
- **Sulphite sensitivity** (particularly common in asthmatics: 5-13% vs 2% general population)
- **Asthma** (sulphites can trigger bronchospasm and breathing difficulties)
- **Allergic rhinitis**
- **True sulphite allergy** (rare but serious - can cause anaphylaxis)

### How Sulphites Cause Symptoms

Sulphites release **sulphur dioxide (SO₂)**, an irritant gas that:
- Irritates and constricts airways
- Causes wheezing, chest tightness, coughing
- Can trigger asthma attacks
- May cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals

For this app, treat sulphite allergy as requiring strict avoidance of all sulphite sources.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Wine - Almost Always Contains Sulphites

**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE (99% of wine contains sulphites)

**Explanation:**
- Wine-making uses sulphites to stop fermentation and prevent spoilage
- Sodium metabisulphite (E223) is the standard wine preservative
- **Even organic wine** usually contains sulphites (just lower levels than conventional)
- **Even "natural" wine** may contain some sulphites (from natural fermentation or added)
- UK law requires "contains sulphites" on label if >10mg/L

**Only SAFE if:** Label explicitly states "sulphite-free" or "no added sulphites" AND total SO₂ <10mg/L

**Common Misconception:** "Organic wine = sulphite-free" - FALSE! Organic wine can contain up to 100mg/L (red) or 120mg/L (white).

---

### Dried Apricots - Colour is the Clue

**Status:** ⚠️ Usually UNSAFE, but safe alternatives exist

**Explanation:**
- **Bright orange dried apricots** → Almost certainly contain sulphites (E220)
- **Dark brown dried apricots** → Likely unsulphured (natural colour)

**Why Bright Orange?** Sulphites preserve the vibrant orange colour. Natural drying turns apricots dark brown.

**Safe Option:** Look for "unsulphured" or "no added sulphites" dried apricots in health food shops.

**UK Availability:** Health food stores, organic sections, online retailers often stock unsulphured versions.

---

### UK Labelling - The 10mg/kg Rule

**Status:** ✅ Legally required declaration

**Explanation:**
- UK/EU law requires foods to declare "contains sulphites" or "sulphur dioxide" if >10mg/kg (or >10mg/L for liquids)
- If label says "contains sulphites" → UNSAFE
- If label does NOT mention sulphites → Usually safe (below 10mg/kg threshold)
- If label lists E220-E228 → UNSAFE

**Important:** The 10mg/kg threshold is VERY LOW. Most people with sulphite sensitivity react to levels well above this, so legally labelled products are usually the problem.

**For this app:** If user has sulphite allergy, flag ANY product with "contains sulphites" or E220-E228 on label.

---

### Sulphur Dioxide vs Sulphites - Same Allergen

**Status:** ❌ Both UNSAFE - they are the same thing

**Explanation:**
- **Sulphur dioxide (SO₂)** is the gas released by sulphites
- **Sulphites** are the sulphur-based compounds (E220-E228)
- They are chemically related and cause the same allergic reactions
- Labels may say "sulphites", "sulphur dioxide", or both

**For this app:** Treat "sulphur dioxide" and "sulphites" as identical allergens.

**Alternative Spellings:** "Sulfites", "sulfur dioxide" (US spelling) - treat as the same allergen.

---

### Medications - Some Contain Sulphites

**Status:** ⚠️ CAUTION - some medications contain sulphites

**Explanation:**
Sodium metabisulphite (E223) is used as a preservative in some medications:
- Some injectable corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone)
- Some local anaesthetics (especially with adrenaline/epinephrine)
- Some eye drops
- Some creams and topical treatments
- Some dental anaesthetics
- Some aminoglycoside antibiotics

**Asthma Inhalers:**
- Some asthma medications contain sulphites (isoproterenol, isoetharine)
- Check with GP/pharmacist if concerned

**Adrenaline/Epinephrine Auto-Injectors:**
- **EpiPen and Jext** contain sodium metabisulphite as a preservative
- **HOWEVER:** Adrenaline is the ONLY treatment for anaphylaxis
- **Do NOT avoid adrenaline** - it should ALWAYS be given in an emergency
- No evidence that sulphites in EpiPen/Jext cause problems during emergency use

**For this app:**
- Flag that some medications contain sulphites
- Advise users to check with GP/pharmacist
- NEVER advise avoiding adrenaline in emergencies

---

### Prawns and Shrimp - Often Treated with Sulphites

**Status:** ⚠️ Often UNSAFE - frequently treated to prevent discolouration

**Explanation:**
- Fresh and frozen prawns/shrimp are commonly treated with sodium metabisulphite (E223)
- Used to prevent "black spot" (melanosis) - a harmless but unsightly discolouration
- Treatment is very common in UK supermarkets

**Safe Options:**
- Check label for "no added sulphites"
- Some organic/premium prawns may be untreated
- Fresh prawns from fishmongers (ask directly)

**For this app:** Flag prawns/shrimp as "may contain sulphites - check label" unless explicitly marked "no added sulphites".

---

### E Numbers Beyond E220-E228 - Other Sulphur Compounds

**Status:** ⚠️ MOSTLY SAFE - but some confusion exists

**Explanation:**
- **E220-E228** are the ONLY sulphite E numbers
- Other E numbers containing "sulph-" are NOT sulphites and are usually safe:
  - E150b, E150d (caramel colours with sulphite ammonia process - usually safe as sulphites removed)

**For this app:** Only flag E220-E228 as sulphites. If uncertain about other sulphur-containing additives, ask user or flag for verification.

---

### Cross-Contamination - Shared Equipment

**Status:** ⚠️ Possible risk in some settings

**Explanation:**
- Unlike other allergens, sulphite cross-contamination is less of a concern
- Sulphites don't transfer easily via shared equipment
- Main risk is from **shared cooking oil** (e.g., chips fried with sulphite-treated foods)

**For this app:** Cross-contamination warnings less critical for sulphites than for other allergens, but mention if relevant.

---

### "No Added Sulphites" vs "Sulphite-Free"

**Status:** ⚠️ Different meanings

**Explanation:**
- **"No added sulphites"** = None deliberately added, but may contain natural trace amounts (e.g., from fermentation)
- **"Sulphite-free"** (legal definition) = <10mg/kg total SO₂

**For this app:** Both are usually safe. Flag products with "contains sulphites" or E220-E228 as UNSAFE.

---

### Organic Foods - Not Automatically Sulphite-Free

**Status:** ⚠️ DEPENDS - organic ≠ sulphite-free

**Explanation:**
- Organic regulations allow sulphites in some products (wine, dried fruit)
- Organic wine can contain up to 100mg/L (red) or 120mg/L (white)
- Some organic dried fruit may still be sulphured

**For this app:** Don't assume "organic" means sulphite-free. Check label for "contains sulphites" or E220-E228.

---

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check for E numbers E220-E228**
- Does the ingredient list contain E220, E221, E222, E223, E224, E226, E227, or E228?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for sulphites

**Step 2: Check for "contains sulphites" declaration**
- Does the label say "contains sulphites" or "contains sulphur dioxide"?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for sulphites

**Step 3: Check if it's a high-risk category**
- Is it wine, dried fruit, pickled food, processed meat, prawns/shrimp?
- If YES → Flag as "likely contains sulphites - check label"

**Step 4: Check if it's a natural whole food**
- Is it fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, fresh meat, fresh fish, eggs, or dairy (unprocessed)?
- If YES → Usually SAFE (no sulphites in fresh, unprocessed foods)

**Step 5: Check if it's processed/preserved**
- Is it a processed food, bottled sauce, convenience food, or preserved product?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain sulphites - check label for E220-E228 or 'contains sulphites'"

**Step 6: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about food preservation and sulphite use
- Research typical sulphite sources in that food category

**Step 7: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain sulphites - please check the label for E220-E228 or 'contains sulphites' declaration"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

---

### Safety Principles for Sulphites:

1. **Fresh is safe** - Fresh, unprocessed foods are virtually always sulphite-free
2. **Check labels** - UK law requires declaration if >10mg/kg
3. **Wine almost always has sulphites** - Assume wine contains sulphites unless explicitly labelled otherwise
4. **Bright colours in dried fruit = sulphites** - Especially bright orange apricots
5. **E220-E228 are all sulphites** - All unsafe for sulphite allergy
6. **Processed/preserved foods are high-risk** - Sulphites are preservatives, so check anything with extended shelf life

---

### Examples of Good AI Behavior:

**Example 1: Item in Taxonomy**
```

AI action: Flag as UNSAFE for sulphites, suggest sulphite-free wine from specialist retailers or alternative (fresh grape juice, non-alcoholic wine)
✅ Correct - assumed wine contains sulphites unless proven otherwise
```

**Example 6: "Organic" Misconception**
```
User ingredient: "Organic white wine"
Taxonomy: Organic wine can still contain up to 120mg/L sulphites
AI action: Flag as likely UNSAFE unless label says "sulphite-free" or "no added sulphites"
✅ Correct - didn't assume organic = sulphite-free
```

**Example 7: Medication Query**
```
User: "I have a sulphite allergy and asthma. Should I avoid my inhaler?"
Taxonomy: Some inhalers contain sulphites, but check with doctor
AI action: Advise user to discuss with GP/pharmacist. Do NOT advise stopping medication without medical guidance.
✅ Correct - deferred to medical professional
