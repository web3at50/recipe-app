# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - MUSTARD

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common mustard-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines and Allergy UK resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for mustard-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about mustard and Brassicaceae family
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain mustard - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Mustard?

Mustard is derived from the seeds of mustard plants in the Brassicaceae (cruciferous) family. It's one of the 14 major allergens recognized in the UK and EU and must be declared on food labels.

**Mustard Species:**
- **Sinapis alba** (White/Yellow mustard)
- **Brassica nigra** (Black mustard)
- **Brassica juncea** (Brown/Indian mustard)

**Who is Affected:**
- People with mustard allergy can experience reactions ranging from mild (itchy mouth, skin rashes) to severe (anaphylaxis)
- Mustard allergy can develop at any age
- More common in areas where mustard is heavily used in cuisine (France, India, UK)

**Cross-Reactivity:**
- Mustard may cross-react with other Brassicaceae vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts)
- Mugwort-Mustard Allergy Syndrome (MMAS) - cross-reactivity with mugwort pollen
- May cross-react with tree nuts, legumes, and certain fruits

For this app, treat mustard allergy as requiring strict mustard avoidance.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Curry Powder - USUALLY UNSAFE
**Status:** ❌ USUALLY UNSAFE - commonly contains mustard seeds
**Explanation:** Most commercial curry powder blends in the UK and worldwide contain mustard seeds (yellow or brown) as a key ingredient. Mustard seeds are traditional in curry powder and add flavour and texture.
**Safe Options:**
- Make your own curry powder without mustard seeds (use turmeric, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, chilli)
- Look for "mustard-free curry powder" (rare but exists)
- Check the label carefully - if mustard is listed, avoid
**Common brands to check:** Schwartz, Bart, supermarket own-brands

---

### Piccalilli - ALWAYS UNSAFE
**Status:** ❌ ALWAYS UNSAFE - contains mustard
**Explanation:** Piccalilli is a traditional British condiment made with pickled vegetables in a mustard and turmeric sauce. Mustard is an essential ingredient and gives piccalilli its characteristic sharp flavour and yellow colour.
**There is NO mustard-free piccalilli.**
**Safe alternatives:**
- Chutney (mustard-free varieties)
- Relish (mustard-free varieties)
- Plain pickled vegetables

---

### Salad Dressings - OFTEN UNSAFE
**Status:** ⚠️ OFTEN UNSAFE - frequently contains mustard
**Explanation:** Mustard is a common ingredient in salad dressings because it acts as an emulsifier (helps oil and vinegar mix) and adds flavour. Even creamy dressings like Caesar and ranch often contain mustard.
**Common dressings with mustard:**
- Vinaigrette (classic French vinaigrette contains mustard)
- Caesar dressing
- Ranch dressing
- Honey mustard dressing (obviously!)
- Blue cheese dressing (some recipes)
**Safe options:**
- Make your own dressings (oil + vinegar + herbs)
- Check labels carefully for "mustard-free" versions
- Use plain olive oil and lemon juice

---

### Mayonnaise - DEPENDS ON BRAND
**Status:** ⚠️ DEPENDS - many contain mustard, some don't
**Explanation:** Mayonnaise recipes vary. Traditional French mayonnaise contains mustard as an emulsifier. Many commercial UK brands use mustard, but some don't.
**UK Brands:**
- **Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise** → Check label (some varieties contain mustard, some don't)
- **Supermarket own-brands** → ALWAYS check label
- **Miracle Whip** → Check label
**Always check the ingredients list.** Mustard will be listed in bold if present.
**Safe alternatives:**
- Mustard-free mayo (check labels)
- Veganaise (check label - some varieties are mustard-free)
- Make your own mayo without mustard

---

### Ketchup - USUALLY SAFE (But Check!)
**Status:** ✅ USUALLY SAFE - most UK brands don't contain mustard
**Explanation:** Most tomato ketchup in the UK (Heinz, supermarket brands) does NOT contain mustard. However, some artisan or specialty ketchups may add mustard for flavour.
**Safe brands (check label to confirm):**
- Heinz Tomato Ketchup
- Most supermarket own-brand ketchups
**Always check:** Specialty ketchups, "gourmet" ketchups, or flavoured ketchups may contain mustard.

---

### Mustard Greens - UNSAFE
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - contains mustard allergen
**Explanation:** Mustard greens (Brassica juncea) are the leaves of the mustard plant. They contain the same allergenic proteins as mustard seeds and will cause reactions in people with mustard allergy.
**Also known as:**
- Sarson ka saag (Indian mustard greens)
- Chinese mustard greens
- Leaf mustard
**Safe alternatives:**
- Spinach, kale, chard, collard greens (different plant families)
- Other leafy greens

---

### Wasabi - TRICKY (Real Wasabi Safe, Imitation May Not Be)
**Status:** ⚠️ DEPENDS on type
**Explanation:**
- **Real wasabi** (Wasabia japonica) is NOT related to mustard and is safe for mustard allergy
- **Imitation wasabi** (common in UK) is often made with horseradish, food colouring, and **mustard or mustard oil**

**In the UK and most restaurants:** "Wasabi" is usually imitation wasabi paste which may contain mustard.

**Check labels:**
- If "wasabi powder" or "wasabi paste" lists mustard → UNSAFE
- If genuine wasabi root → SAFE
- If horseradish-based without mustard → SAFE

**When eating out:** Always ask or avoid, as most sushi restaurants use imitation wasabi with mustard.

---

### Canola Oil / Rapeseed Oil - DEPENDS ON PROCESSING
**Status:** ⚠️ REFINED = SAFE, COLD-PRESSED = UNSAFE
**Explanation:** Canola oil comes from rapeseed, which is in the Brassicaceae family (related to mustard).
- **Highly refined canola/rapeseed oil** → ✅ SAFE - refining process removes allergenic proteins
- **Cold-pressed/virgin canola/rapeseed oil** → ❌ UNSAFE - less refined, may contain residual proteins

**In the UK:**
- Most commercial cooking oils (vegetable oil, rapeseed oil) are highly refined → usually safe
- "Cold-pressed rapeseed oil" or "extra virgin rapeseed oil" → avoid if mustard allergic

**FSA Guidance:** Refined oils are generally safe, but if in doubt, use alternative oils (olive, sunflower, coconut).

---

### Cross-Contamination in Restaurants
**Items that MAY be contaminated:**
- Sandwiches (even if ordered without mustard, may be cross-contaminated from shared equipment)
- Burgers and hot dogs (grills may have mustard residue)

- Avoid buffets and shared condiment stations
- Check if "mustard-free" preparation is possible

---

### Brassicaceae Family Vegetables - USUALLY SAFE (But May Cross-React)
**Status:** ✅ USUALLY SAFE for most people, but individual reactions vary
**Explanation:** The following vegetables are in the same family as mustard (Brassicaceae/cruciferous) but most people with mustard allergy can eat them safely:
- Broccoli
- Cabbage (white, red, savoy)
- Cauliflower
- Brussels sprouts
- Kale
- Bok choy
- Turnip
- Radish
- Rocket (arugula)

**However:** Some people with mustard allergy experience cross-reactivity with these vegetables. Symptoms are usually mild (oral allergy syndrome - itchy mouth/throat).

**Recommendation:** Most people can eat these safely, but if user reports reactions, recommend avoiding or limiting Brassicaceae vegetables.

---

### "Spices" or "Natural Flavourings" on Labels - CAUTION
**Status:** ⚠️ MAY contain mustard
**Explanation:** In the UK, mustard must be declared on labels if used as an ingredient. However, in imported products or non-UK-regulated foods, "spices" or "natural flavourings" may hide mustard.
**FSA Regulation:** In the UK, if mustard is present, it MUST be listed in bold in the ingredients list (as one of the 14 major allergens).
**Recommendation:**
- UK-produced foods → "spices" usually safe (mustard would be listed separately)
- Imported foods → Check with manufacturer if "spices" listed
- When in doubt, avoid or contact manufacturer
