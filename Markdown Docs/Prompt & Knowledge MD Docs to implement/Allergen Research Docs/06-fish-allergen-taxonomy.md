# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - FISH

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of fish-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines and Allergy UK resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for fish-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about fish and fish derivatives
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain fish - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Fish Allergy?

Fish allergy is one of the **14 major allergens** regulated under UK law (Natasha's Law). It refers to finned fish species (not shellfish, which is a separate allergen category).

**Key Facts:**
- Fish allergy affects approximately 1% of the UK population
- It can cause severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis
- Unlike many childhood allergies, fish allergy often persists into adulthood
- People allergic to one type of fish are often allergic to others (cross-reactivity)
- **Fish vs Shellfish:** These are DIFFERENT allergen categories with different proteins

**Main Allergenic Protein:**
The primary allergen in fish is **parvalbumin**, a protein found in fish muscle tissue. This protein is:
- Heat-stable (cooking doesn't destroy it)
- Present in all finned fish species
- Can trigger reactions even in small amounts

**Important Distinction:**
- **FISH** = Finned fish (cod, salmon, tuna, etc.) - THIS taxonomy
- **SHELLFISH/CRUSTACEANS** = Prawns, crab, lobster - DIFFERENT allergen
- **MOLLUSCS** = Squid, mussels, oysters - DIFFERENT allergen

For this app, treat fish allergy as requiring strict avoidance of all finned fish and fish-derived products.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Worcestershire Sauce - UNSAFE (Contains Anchovies)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE for fish allergy
**Explanation:** Traditional Worcestershire sauce (Lea & Perrins, most UK brands) contains anchovies as a key ingredient.
**Common in:** Shepherd's pie, cottage pie, stews, marinades, Bloody Mary cocktails, some barbecue sauces
**Safe Alternative:** Henderson's Relish (Sheffield product, fish-free), or vegan Worcestershire sauce
**Warning:** Many processed foods contain Worcestershire sauce - check labels carefully!

---

### Caesar Dressing - UNSAFE (Contains Anchovies)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE for fish allergy
**Explanation:** Traditional Caesar dressing is made with anchovies (or anchovy paste) as an essential ingredient.
**Common in:** Caesar salads, chicken Caesar wraps, some pasta dishes
**Safe Alternative:** Vegan Caesar dressing (made without anchovies), or make your own with garlic, lemon, mustard, and mayo
**Tip:** Always ask restaurants if their Caesar dressing contains anchovies

---

### Fish Sauce in Asian Cuisine - VERY HIGH RISK
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - contains concentrated fish
**Explanation:** Fish sauce (nam pla, nuoc mam) is a staple in Thai, Vietnamese, and Filipino cooking. Made from fermented fish, it's used in almost every dish.
**High-risk dishes:**
- Thai: Pad Thai, green curry, tom yum soup, papaya salad
- Vietnamese: Pho, spring rolls, banh mi, nuoc cham dipping sauce
- Filipino: Adobo, sinigang, pancit

**Safe Alternative:** Soy sauce, coconut aminos, mushroom-flavored soy sauce
**Restaurant Warning:** Even vegetable dishes in Thai/Vietnamese restaurants often contain fish sauce - always ask!

---

### Surimi (Imitation Crab) - UNSAFE (Made from Fish)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - made from fish (usually pollock)
**Explanation:** Surimi, sold as "imitation crab sticks" or "seafood sticks", is NOT made from crab. It's made from white fish (usually pollock) that's been processed and flavored.
**Common in:** Sushi (California rolls), seafood salads, seafood pasta
**Warning:** The name is misleading - it contains REAL FISH even though it says "imitation crab"

---

### Omega-3 Supplements - DEPENDS ON SOURCE
**Status:** ⚠️ CHECK SOURCE - fish oil vs algae oil
**Explanation:** Most omega-3 supplements are fish oil-based (unsafe). However, algae-based omega-3 supplements are safe.
**UNSAFE:** Fish oil, cod liver oil, krill oil (contains omega-3 from fish/crustaceans)
**SAFE:** Algae oil, algal oil, "plant-based omega-3", "vegan omega-3"
**Look for labels:** "Derived from algae", "Plant-based", "Suitable for vegans"
**Tip:** Algae oil provides the same DHA/EPA as fish oil without the fish allergen

---

### Isinglass (Fish Gelatin) in Drinks
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - derived from fish
**Explanation:** Isinglass is a type of gelatin obtained from fish bladders, used to clarify (filter) some beers, wines, and ciders.
**Common in:** Traditional cask ales, some wines, some ciders
**Amount:** Usually trace amounts (filtered out), but may still trigger allergies
**Safe Alternative:** Look for vegan-friendly beers/wines (use plant-based fining agents)
**UK Examples:** Many UK real ales use isinglass - check brewery websites or ask

---

### Fish Stock and Dashi - UNSAFE
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE for fish allergy
**Explanation:** Fish stock is made by simmering fish bones/heads. Dashi (Japanese stock) often uses bonito flakes (dried fish flakes).
**Common in:** Soups, stews, risottos, Japanese cuisine (miso soup, ramen)
**Safe Alternatives:**
- Vegetable stock
- Chicken stock, Beef stock
- Kombu dashi (kelp-only, no bonito)
- Mushroom stock

---

### Taramasalata - UNSAFE (Contains Fish Roe)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - contains cod roe (fish eggs)
**Explanation:** Taramasalata is a Greek/Mediterranean dip made from fish roe (usually cod roe or carp roe).
**Common in:** Mezze platters, Greek restaurants, supermarket dip selections
**Safe Alternatives:** Hummus, baba ganoush, tzatziki (yogurt dip)

---

### Fish vs Shellfish - NOT THE SAME ALLERGEN
**Important:** Fish allergy and shellfish allergy are DIFFERENT
**Explanation:**
- **Fish allergy** = Reaction to finned fish (parvalbumin protein)
- **Shellfish allergy** = Reaction to crustaceans/molluscs (tropomyosin protein)
- **Different proteins** = Separate allergies

**Key Points:**
- You can be allergic to fish but not shellfish (and vice versa)
- About 15-20% of people with fish allergy also have shellfish allergy
- If user has ONLY fish allergy → Shellfish are technically safe (but warn about cross-contamination)
- If user has BOTH → Avoid all seafood

**Cross-Contamination Risk:**
- Shared processing facilities
- Shared fryers in restaurants (fish and chips with scampi)
- Shared cutting boards, utensils
- For severe fish allergy: May want to avoid shellfish restaurants even if not allergic

---

### Vegetarian/Vegan Dishes May Still Contain Fish
**Status:** ⚠️ CHECK CAREFULLY
**Explanation:** "Vegetarian" doesn't always mean fish-free in some cultures
**Examples:**
- Thai vegetarian dishes may still use fish sauce (check!)
- Some vegetable stocks contain fish extract
- Some Asian "vegetable" broths contain fish or shellfish
- Worcestershire sauce in vegetarian dishes (contains anchovies)

**Best Practice:** Always specify "fish allergy" rather than just asking if vegetarian

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's a fish or fish derivative**
- Does the name contain "fish", "salmon", "tuna", "cod", "anchovy", etc.?
- Is it a fish sauce, fish stock, fish oil, or fish extract?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for fish allergy

**Step 2: Check if it's an Asian sauce or condiment**
- Is it Thai, Vietnamese, Filipino, or other Southeast Asian?
- Could it contain fish sauce as an ingredient?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain fish sauce - please verify"

**Step 3: Check if it's a processed sauce or condiment**
- Is it Worcestershire sauce, Caesar dressing, or a barbecue sauce?
- Could it contain anchovies or fish extract?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain fish/anchovies - check label"

**Step 4: Check if it's an omega-3 supplement**
- Is it fish oil, cod liver oil, or omega-3?
- If YES → Ask "Is this algae-based or fish oil-based?"
- Fish oil = UNSAFE, Algae oil = SAFE

**Step 5: Check if it's shellfish/seafood (different allergen)**
- Is it prawn, crab, lobster, mussels, squid, oysters?
- If YES → Flag as "This is SHELLFISH (different allergen from fish). User may tolerate this, but warn about cross-contamination risk."

**Step 6: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about food composition and ingredients
- Research the ingredient's typical composition

**Step 7: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain fish - please verify the label or specify the exact ingredients"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

### Safety Principles for Fish Allergy:

1. **Asian cuisine = HIGH RISK** - Fish sauce is ubiquitous in Thai/Vietnamese cooking
2. **Anchovies hide in sauces** - Worcestershire, Caesar dressing, some pizzas
3. **Surimi is fish** - "Imitation crab" is made from real fish (pollock)
4. **Fish oil ≠ Algae oil** - Check omega-3 source carefully
5. **Shellfish is different** - Fish and shellfish are separate allergens (but cross-contamination risk)
6. **Check all sauces** - Many contain fish derivatives (Worcestershire, Caesar, Asian sauces)
7. **Vegetarian ≠ Fish-free** - Some cultures include fish sauce in "vegetarian" dishes
