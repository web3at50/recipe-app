# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - CELERY

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common celery-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines and Allergy UK resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for celery-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about celery and its derivatives
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain celery - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Celery Allergy?

Celery is one of the 14 major allergens that must be declared on food labels in the UK. Celery allergy can cause reactions ranging from mild oral symptoms to severe anaphylaxis.

**Key Facts:**
- Celery allergy is thought to be rare in the UK but reactions can sometimes be serious
- Reactions can range from mild itching/tingling to anaphylaxis requiring an adrenaline auto-injector
- The allergen includes celery stalks, leaves, seeds, root (celeriac), and all derivatives
- Celery allergen is **heat-resistant** - cooking does NOT make it safe
- Dried celery spice remains allergenic despite processing

**Two Types of Celery Allergy:**

1. **Pollen-Food Syndrome (Oral Allergy Syndrome):**
   - Associated with birch and mugwort pollen allergies
   - Often called "Birch-Mugwort-Celery Syndrome"
   - Usually causes mild oral symptoms (itching, tingling in mouth/throat/lips)
   - Symptoms typically remain mild and don't progress

2. **Primary Celery Allergy:**
   - Not associated with pollen allergies
   - Less common but may cause more severe reactions
   - Can lead to anaphylaxis

For this app, treat both types as requiring strict celery avoidance.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Celeriac - UNSAFE (Despite Being a "Root")
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE for celery allergies
**Explanation:** Celeriac (also called celery root or celery knob) is NOT a safe alternative to celery stalks. It is the root of a celery plant variety (Apium graveolens rapaceum) and contains the same allergens as celery stalks.
**Other names:** Celery root, celery knob, turnip-rooted celery, knob celery
**Important:** If you are allergic to celery stalks, you MUST avoid celeriac
**Common uses:** Celeriac is used in soups, remoulade (French salad), roasted vegetables, mash, and gratins

---

### Celery Salt - UNSAFE (Not Just Table Salt)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - contains celery
**Explanation:** Celery salt is NOT just table salt with a celery flavour - it is made from ground celery seeds mixed with salt. It contains actual celery allergen.
**Common uses:** Seasoning for salads, eggs, Bloody Mary cocktails, Chicago-style hot dogs, coleslaw
**Safe alternative:** Use regular salt, garlic salt (check label), or onion salt (check label)

---

### Celery Seeds - UNSAFE (Full Allergen Preserved)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - highly allergenic
**Explanation:** Research has demonstrated that celery spice is allergenic to individuals with celery allergy despite being dried and powdered. Drying and processing do NOT remove or reduce the allergen.
**Found in:** Spice mixes, pickling spices, some bread/crackers, some curry powders, some BBQ seasonings
**Important:** Even tiny amounts in spice blends can trigger reactions

---

### Heat Resistance - Cooking Does NOT Make Celery Safe
**Status:** ⚠️ Cooking does NOT eliminate allergen
**Explanation:** Unlike some allergens that are broken down by heat, celery allergen is heat-stable. When celery is cooked extensively, it still retains its allergenicity and must be avoided.
**This means:**
- Cooked celery in soups/stews is still allergenic
- Celery in stock (even well-boiled) is still allergenic
- Roasted celeriac is still allergenic
- Celery in ready meals is still allergenic
**Exception:** Unlike many pollen-related food allergies (where cooking can make foods safer), celery remains dangerous even when cooked

---

### Birch-Mugwort-Celery Syndrome - Cross-Reactivity
**Status:** ⚠️ Important for hay fever sufferers
**Explanation:** Celery allergy is often associated with birch and/or mugwort pollen allergies. This is called "Birch-Mugwort-Celery Syndrome" or "Celery-Mugwort-Spice Syndrome."
**Who it affects:** People with hay fever (particularly birch or mugwort pollen allergies)
**Symptoms:** Often causes Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS) - itching or tingling in mouth, throat or lips, slight swelling
**Usually mild:** OAS symptoms typically remain mild and don't progress
**Cross-reactive foods:** If you have this syndrome, you may also react to:
  - Other Apiaceae family members (carrots, parsley, parsnips, fennel, coriander, anise)
  - Certain spices (cumin, caraway, aniseed)
  - Certain fruits (apples, peaches, plums, cherries)
**Important:** Even though it's pollen-related, celery allergen is NOT destroyed by cooking (unlike many OAS foods)

---

### Primary Celery Allergy - More Severe
**Status:** ⚠️ Can cause anaphylaxis
**Explanation:** Primary celery allergy (not associated with pollen allergies) is less common but may cause more severe reactions including anaphylaxis.
**Difference from OAS:** Not related to hay fever, can cause serious systemic reactions
**Treatment:** May require adrenaline auto-injector (EpiPen)
**For this app:** Treat all celery allergies as potentially serious and recommend strict avoidance

---

### Stock Cubes - Most Contain Celery
**Status:** ⚠️ Assume UNSAFE unless verified
**Explanation:** The vast majority of vegetable stock cubes sold in the UK contain celery. Even some chicken and beef stock cubes may contain celery.
**Safest approach:** Make your own stock or use verified celery-free brands
**In UK:** Celery must be declared on labels (will be bold or underlined)
**Check carefully:** Don't assume a stock cube is safe - always read the label

---

### Natural Flavourings and Spices - CHECK CAREFULLY
**Status:** ⚠️ May contain hidden celery
**Explanation:** "Natural flavourings," "vegetable flavourings," "spices," or "mixed spices" on labels may include celery.
**In UK:** If celery is present, it must be declared separately on the label (celery will appear in bold/underlined)
**If label just says:** "Natural flavourings" with no celery declaration → Should be safe in UK
**If uncertain:** In rare cases where labelling is unclear, flag as "may contain celery - please verify"

---

### Cross-Contamination Warnings
**Items that MAY be contaminated:**
- Fresh produce stored near celery in refrigerators
- Salad bars and buffets (shared tongs, proximity to celery sticks)
- Sandwich shops (shared cutting boards, knives)
- Deli counters (shared serving utensils)
- Restaurant kitchens (shared cutting boards, vegetable prep areas)

**For this app:** If user has celery allergy, recommend:
- Wash all vegetables thoroughly if stored near celery
- Ask restaurants about celery in stocks, sauces, and preparations
- Be cautious at buffets and salad bars
- Inform kitchen staff about allergy severity

---

### Apiaceae Family - Potential Cross-Reactions
**Status:** ⚠️ Be aware of related vegetables
**Explanation:** Celery belongs to the Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) family. Some people with celery allergy may react to related vegetables, though not everyone will.
**Other Apiaceae members:**
  - Carrots (Daucus carota)
  - Parsnips (Pastinaca sativa)
  - Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare)
  - Parsley (Petroselinum crispum)
  - Coriander/Cilantro (Coriandrum sativum)
  - Dill (Anethum graveolens)
  - Cumin (Cuminum cyminum)
  - Caraway (Carum carvi)
  - Anise (Pimpinella anisum)
  - Lovage (Levisticum officinale)
**For this app:** Don't automatically flag these as unsafe, but if user reports celery allergy AND has had reactions to related vegetables, be cautious and mention the potential cross-reactivity

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's a celery derivative**
- Does the name contain "celery", "celeriac", "celery root", "celery seed", "celery salt"?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for celery allergy

**Step 2: Check if it's in the Apiaceae family**
- Is it parsley, parsnips, carrots, fennel, coriander, dill, cumin, caraway, or lovage?
- If YES → Generally safe, but mention potential cross-reactivity if user has birch-mugwort-celery syndrome

**Step 3: Check if it's a processed product**
- Is it a stock, bouillon, soup, sauce, ready meal, or spice blend?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain celery - check labels carefully"

**Step 4: Check if it's a natural whole food**
- Is it a fresh vegetable, fruit, meat, fish, egg, nut, or seed (not celery)?
- If YES → Usually SAFE (unless it's celeriac!)

**Step 5: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about food composition and celery usage
- Consider if celery is traditionally used in that dish or product

**Step 6: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain celery - please verify the label or use a celery-free version"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

---

### Safety Principles for Celery:

1. **Cooking doesn't help** - Celery allergen is heat-stable, unlike many allergens
2. **Celeriac is NOT safe** - Despite being a root, it contains the same allergen
3. **Stock cubes are risky** - Most UK vegetable stock cubes contain celery
4. **Seeds are allergenic** - Dried celery seed/salt is just as dangerous as fresh celery
5. **UK labels are reliable** - In the UK, celery must be declared (bold/underlined)
6. **Check processed foods** - Celery hides in soups, stocks, sauces, seasonings
7. **Pollen link matters** - Hay fever sufferers may have milder (but still important) reactions
8. **Cross-contamination counts** - Mention if shared equipment could be an issue
