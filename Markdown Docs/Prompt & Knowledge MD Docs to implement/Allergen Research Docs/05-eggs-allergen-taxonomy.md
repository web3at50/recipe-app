# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - EGGS

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common egg-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines, Allergy UK resources, and NHS guidance. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for egg-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about egg-containing foods
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain egg - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Egg Allergy?

Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies, especially in children. It occurs when the immune system reacts to proteins found in eggs, primarily:
- **Ovalbumin** (Gal d 2) - 54% of egg white protein
- **Ovomucoid** (Gal d 1) - 11% of egg white protein
- **Ovotransferrin** (Gal d 3) - 12% of egg white protein
- **Lysozyme** (Gal d 4) - 3.4% of egg white protein

**Important Facts:**
- Eggs are one of the **14 major allergens** that must be declared on UK food labels
- Most egg allergy reactions are to **egg white** proteins, but some people are allergic to egg yolk as well
- Around **80% of people** with egg allergy can tolerate well-baked egg (e.g., in cakes), but this must be determined individually
- Many children **outgrow** egg allergy by school age, though some remain allergic into adulthood

**Reactions Range From:**
- **Mild:** Skin rash (hives/urticaria), itching, swelling around lips or eyes
- **Moderate:** Vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, eczema flares
- **Severe:** Anaphylaxis (difficulty breathing, wheezing, throat swelling, drop in blood pressure)

For this app, we assume **all egg exposure should be avoided** unless the user specifically indicates they can tolerate baked egg.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Baked Egg - POTENTIALLY SAFE for SOME People
**Status:** ⚠️ SAFE for approximately 80% of egg-allergic individuals, but must be determined individually
**Explanation:** Around 80% of people with egg allergy can tolerate **well-baked egg** in products like cakes or muffins, where the egg protein is significantly broken down by prolonged high heat. However, this does NOT apply to everyone and should only be determined under medical supervision.

**Safe "Baked Egg" Products (for those who can tolerate):**
- Well-baked cakes and muffins (baked at high temperature for extended time)
- Biscuits baked thoroughly

**NOT Safe Even for "Baked Egg Tolerance":**
- Lightly cooked eggs (scrambled, fried, poached, boiled)
- Meringues (egg white not sufficiently denatured)
- Fresh pasta (egg not thoroughly cooked)
- Mayonnaise (raw egg)
- Mousses (raw or lightly cooked egg)

**For This App:**
- **Default assumption:** Avoid ALL egg-containing foods
- **Exception:** If user explicitly states they can tolerate "baked egg," you may allow well-baked goods
- **Always ask** if uncertain: "Can you tolerate baked egg (e.g., in cakes), or do you need to avoid all egg?"

---

### Lecithin (E322) - USUALLY SAFE (But Check!)
**Status:** ✅ USUALLY SAFE - typically soy-based, but CAN be egg-based
**Explanation:** Lecithin is a common emulsifier found in chocolate, baked goods, and many processed foods. In the UK and most of the world, lecithin is almost always derived from **soy** (soya lecithin), which is egg-free.

**However:**
- Occasionally, lecithin can be derived from **egg yolks** (egg lecithin)
- UK food labels must specify if lecithin is from eggs: "lecithin (egg)" or "egg lecithin"
- If the label just says "lecithin" or "soy lecithin" → it is egg-free

**For This App:**
- If ingredient says "lecithin" or "soy lecithin" or "E322" without egg mentioned → assume safe
- If ingredient says "egg lecithin" or "lecithin (egg)" → flag as unsafe
- When uncertain, flag as: "Lecithin source unclear - verify label shows soy-based"

---

### Lysozyme (E1105) - UNSAFE (Contains Egg Protein)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - derived from egg whites
**Explanation:** Lysozyme is an enzyme naturally found in egg whites (3.4% of egg white protein) and is used as a preservative and bactericide in foods and medications. Up to 32% of people with egg allergy are sensitized to lysozyme.

**Common Products Containing Lysozyme:**
- Some cheeses (used as preservative)
- Some wines (used in production)
- Some cough syrups and throat lozenges
- Some medications (nasal sprays, eye drops)
- Some processed foods

**For This App:**
- Always flag lysozyme (E1105) as unsafe for egg allergy
- Suggest checking medication labels for lysozyme if user has egg allergy

---

### Pasta - DEPENDS (Fresh Often Contains Egg, Dried Usually Doesn't)
**Status:** ⚠️ Check type and label
**Explanation:**
- **Fresh pasta** (sold refrigerated) - Almost always contains eggs
- **Dried pasta** (boxed, shelf-stable) - Usually egg-free (just durum wheat and water)
- **Egg noodles** - Always contain eggs (it's in the name!)

**Safe Pasta Types:**
- Most dried pasta (spaghetti, penne, fusilli - check label to confirm)
- Rice noodles
- Glass noodles (mung bean)
- Corn pasta
- Egg-free fresh pasta (labeled as vegan or egg-free)

**Unsafe Pasta Types:**
- Fresh pasta (unless labeled egg-free)
- Egg noodles
- Some specialty dried pasta (check labels)

**For This App:**
- If recipe calls for "pasta" → default to dried pasta (usually egg-free) and suggest checking label
- If recipe calls for "fresh pasta" → flag as likely contains egg, suggest dried pasta or egg-free alternative
- If recipe calls for "egg noodles" → flag as unsafe, suggest rice noodles or egg-free pasta

---

### Mayonnaise - UNSAFE (Traditional), SAFE (Vegan Versions)
**Status:** ⚠️ Traditional mayonnaise contains eggs, but vegan versions are widely available
**Explanation:** Traditional mayonnaise is an emulsion made from **egg yolks**, oil, and vinegar or lemon juice. It is unsafe for egg allergy.

**Unsafe:**
- Hellmann's Real Mayonnaise (contains eggs)
- Heinz Seriously Good Mayonnaise (contains eggs)
- Most traditional mayonnaise brands
- Homemade mayonnaise (usually contains eggs)

**Safe Alternatives (Vegan Mayo - Widely Available in UK):**
- Tesco Plant Chef Vegan Mayo
- Sacla Vegan Mayonnaise
- Hellmann's Vegan Mayo
- Heinz Seriously Good Vegan Mayo
- Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Asda vegan mayo options

**For This App:**
- If recipe calls for "mayonnaise" → flag traditional mayo as unsafe, suggest vegan mayo alternatives
- Provide UK-specific brand recommendations (see list above)

---

### Meringue - UNSAFE (Pure Egg White)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - made from egg whites
**Explanation:** Meringue is made by whipping egg whites with sugar until stiff peaks form. It is essentially pure egg white protein and is extremely unsafe for egg allergy.

**Unsafe:**
- Meringue nests
- Pavlova
- Lemon meringue pie
- Meringue kisses
- Macarons (almond meringue cookies)
- Any dessert topped with meringue

**Safe Alternative:**
- **Aquafaba meringue** - Made from chickpea water (aquafaba), whipped like egg whites
- Vegan meringues (made with aquafaba)

**For This App:**
- Always flag meringue as unsafe
- Suggest aquafaba as egg-free alternative for making meringues

---

### Egg Wash (Glaze on Breads) - UNSAFE
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - contains egg brushed on surface
**Explanation:** Many breads, buns, pretzels, and pastries are brushed with beaten egg before baking to create a shiny, golden glaze. Even if the bread dough itself is egg-free, the egg wash makes the product unsafe.

**Products Often Egg-Washed:**
- Brioche (also contains egg in dough)
- Challah bread (also contains egg in dough)
- Hot cross buns (egg-washed surface)
- Pretzels (soft pretzels often egg-washed)
- Some bagels (egg-washed)
- Pies and pastries (egg-washed crusts)

**For This App:**
- Check for "egg wash" or "glazed with egg" on labels
- If bread looks shiny and golden, flag as potentially egg-washed
- Suggest egg-free breads (traditional loaves, ciabatta, sourdough)

---

### Flu Vaccine - POTENTIALLY SAFE (With Precautions)
**Status:** ⚠️ Contains egg proteins, but most egg-allergic individuals can receive it safely
**Explanation:** Most flu vaccines are manufactured using egg-based technology and contain small amounts of egg protein (ovalbumin). However, UK guidance now allows most egg-allergic individuals to receive flu vaccines in primary care settings.

**Key Facts:**
- Nasal spray flu vaccine (Fluenz® Tetra) contains less than 0.024 micrograms of ovalbumin per dose
- Injectable flu vaccines contain between 0.05 to 1 microgram of ovalbumin per dose
- **MMR vaccine is SAFE** - does not contain egg protein

**UK Guidance:**
- Most people with egg allergy (including children) can receive flu vaccine in primary care or schools
- Severe egg allergy requiring intensive care may need specialist supervision
- Egg-free flu vaccines (cell-cultured) available for those with severe allergies

**For This App:**
- If user mentions flu vaccine concerns, inform them that most egg-allergic individuals can receive it safely
- Suggest consulting healthcare provider for personalized advice
- Reassure that MMR vaccine is safe for egg allergy

---

### Cross-Contamination Warnings
**Items That MAY Be Contaminated:**
- Foods processed in facilities that also process eggs
- Shared cooking equipment (pans, utensils)
- Shared fryers (chips cooked in same oil as battered foods)
- Bakery items (made in same facility as egg-containing baked goods)

**For This App:** If user has egg allergy, recommend:
- Check labels for "may contain egg" warnings
- Ask about preparation methods in restaurants
- Use separate cooking equipment at home
- Be cautious with bakery items unless certified egg-free

---

### UK-Specific Confusions

**"Free-Range" or "Organic" Eggs:**
- These are still eggs! The terms refer to farming practices, not egg-free alternatives
- Unsafe for egg allergy

**"Vegan" Label:**
- If a product is labeled "vegan," it is guaranteed egg-free (no animal products)
- Safe for egg allergy (unless cross-contamination warning)

**"Plant-Based" Label:**
- Usually egg-free, but check labels (some "plant-based" products may contain traces)
- Generally safe, but verify

---

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's an egg derivative**
- Does the name contain "ovo-", "ova-", "egg", "albumin", "meringue"?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for egg allergy

**Step 2: Check if it's a processed product**
- Is it a baked good, sauce, dessert, battered/breaded food, or processed meat?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain egg - check labels"

**Step 3: Check if it's a natural whole food**
- Is it a fresh vegetable, fruit, meat, fish, dairy, nut, or seed?
- If YES → Usually SAFE (unless battered, breaded, or processed with egg)

**Step 4: Check for egg as a binder or emulsifier**
- Is it a burger, meatball, fish cake, pastry, or similar item that needs binding?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain egg as binder - check label"

**Step 5: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about food preparation and egg usage
- Research the ingredient's typical composition if needed

**Step 6: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain egg - please verify the label or use a certified egg-free version"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

---

### Safety Principles for Egg Allergy:

1. **Always check processed foods** - Eggs hide in unexpected places (binders, glazes, emulsifiers)
2. **Fresh/natural is usually safe** - Fresh whole foods are typically egg-free
3. **Baked goods need verification** - Most contain eggs unless labeled egg-free/vegan
4. **Vegan = Egg-free** - Vegan products are always safe for egg allergy
5. **UK labels are reliable** - In the UK, egg-containing ingredients must be declared
6. **Baked egg tolerance varies** - Don't assume someone can tolerate baked egg without confirmation

---

### Examples of Good AI Behavior:

**Example 1: Item in Taxonomy**
```
User ingredient: "Mayonnaise"
Taxonomy says: Traditional mayo contains eggs - UNSAFE
AI action: Flag allergen conflict, suggest vegan mayonnaise as alternative (Hellmann's Vegan, Tesco Plant Chef)
✅ Correct
```

**Example 2: Item NOT in Taxonomy**
```
User ingredient: "Egg protein powder"
Taxonomy: Not listed explicitly, but clearly an egg product
AI knowledge: Contains concentrated egg proteins
AI action: Flag as UNSAFE even though not explicitly listed
✅ Correct - used own knowledge
```

**Example 3: Uncertain Item**
```
User ingredient: "Fresh ravioli"
Taxonomy: Fresh pasta usually contains eggs
AI action: Flag as "likely contains egg - check label or use dried pasta alternative"
✅ Correct - cautious approach with alternative suggestion
```

**Example 4: False Positive Avoided**
```
User ingredient: "Lecithin (E322)"
Taxonomy: Usually soy-based (safe), but can be egg-based
AI action: Check if label specifies "egg lecithin" - if not specified, likely soy-based and safe
✅ Correct - followed taxonomy's tricky cases section
```

**Example 5: Baked Egg Question**
```
User: "I have egg allergy, can I eat this cake?"
AI action: Ask "Can you tolerate baked egg (like in cakes), or do you need to avoid all egg?"
User: "I can eat baked egg"
AI action: Proceed with cake recipe
✅ Correct - clarified individual tolerance
```
