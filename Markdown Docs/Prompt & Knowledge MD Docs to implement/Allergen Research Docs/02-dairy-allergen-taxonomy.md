# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - DAIRY/MILK

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common dairy/milk-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines, Allergy UK, and NHS resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for dairy/milk-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about dairy/milk products
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain dairy - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Dairy/Milk Allergy?

Milk allergy is a reaction to the proteins found in cow's milk and other mammalian milks. The two main proteins that cause reactions are:
- **Casein** (makes up about 80% of milk protein)
- **Whey** (makes up about 20% of milk protein)

Milk allergy affects people with:
- **IgE-mediated milk allergy** (immediate reactions - can be severe/anaphylaxis)
- **Non-IgE-mediated milk allergy** (delayed reactions - digestive issues, eczema)
- **Mixed IgE and non-IgE milk allergy** (both immediate and delayed symptoms)

**Important:** Milk allergy is DIFFERENT from lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance is a digestive issue with milk sugar, NOT an allergy to milk proteins.

For this app, treat milk allergy as requiring strict avoidance of all dairy products and milk derivatives.

**Note:** Milk from other mammals (goat, sheep, buffalo) should also be avoided as they contain similar proteins.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Lactose-Free Milk - UNSAFE for Milk Allergy
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE for milk allergy (⚠️ Safe for lactose intolerance only)
**Explanation:** Lactose-free milk has the lactose (milk sugar) removed or broken down, but it is still cow's milk and still contains the proteins casein and whey that cause allergic reactions.
**Remember:** Lactose-free ≠ Dairy-free
- Lactose-free = Still contains milk proteins (casein and whey) → UNSAFE for allergy
- Dairy-free = Contains NO milk proteins → SAFE for allergy
**Examples of lactose-free products that are UNSAFE for milk allergy:**
- Lactofree milk (contains milk proteins)
- Arla Lactofree products
- Lactose-free cheese (still contains milk proteins)

---

### A2 Milk - UNSAFE for Milk Allergy
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE for milk allergy
**Explanation:** A2 milk contains a different type of beta-casein protein (A2 instead of A1), but it is still cow's milk with casein and whey proteins. Some people find it easier to digest, but it is NOT safe for people with milk protein allergy.
**Product:** a2 Milk brand (available in UK supermarkets)

---

### Ghee and Clarified Butter - PROBABLY UNSAFE
**Status:** ⚠️ UNSAFE for milk allergy (use extreme caution)
**Explanation:** Ghee and clarified butter are made by removing most milk solids from butter, which removes most lactose and reduces milk proteins. However, trace amounts of milk proteins (casein, whey) may still remain.
**UK Allergen Law:** Ghee is derived from milk (one of the 14 major allergens), so it must be declared on UK food labels.
**Recommendation for this app:**
- Treat ghee as UNSAFE for milk allergy due to possible trace proteins
- May be tolerated by people with lactose intolerance
- If user has milk allergy, recommend avoiding or checking with their doctor
**Safe alternative:** Coconut oil, vegetable ghee (pure plant-based)

---

### Lactic Acid - USUALLY SAFE
**Status:** ✅ USUALLY SAFE (despite the name)
**Explanation:** Lactic acid can be derived from milk (lactose), but most commercially produced lactic acid is now made by bacterial fermentation of plant sugars (corn, beets, sugar cane). In the UK, if lactic acid is derived from milk, it must be labeled.
**Check labels:**
- If label says "lactic acid (from milk)" → UNSAFE
- If label just says "lactic acid" → Usually safe (plant-derived)
- E270 (lactic acid) → Usually safe unless specified as milk-derived
**Common in:** Bread, pickles, fermented foods, some sweets

---

### Lactate - USUALLY SAFE
**Status:** ✅ USUALLY SAFE
**Explanation:** Similar to lactic acid, lactate (and its derivatives like calcium lactate, sodium lactate) can be milk-derived but is usually plant-derived. UK labeling requires declaring if milk-derived.
**Examples:**
- Calcium lactate (E327)
- Sodium lactate (E325)
- Potassium lactate (E326)

---

### Cocoa Butter - SAFE (Not Dairy!)
**Status:** ✅ SAFE - Contains NO dairy
**Explanation:** Despite the word "butter," cocoa butter is pure fat from cocoa beans. It contains NO dairy and is safe for milk allergy.
**Found in:** Chocolate, cosmetics, some baked goods

---

### Shea Butter - SAFE (Not Dairy!)
**Status:** ✅ SAFE - Contains NO dairy
**Explanation:** Shea butter is from shea tree nuts, NOT dairy. It is safe for milk allergy.
**Found in:** Cosmetics, lotions (not typically in food)

---

### Peanut Butter - SAFE (Not Dairy!)
**Status:** ✅ SAFE - Contains NO dairy (unless added)
**Explanation:** Peanut butter is made from peanuts, NOT dairy. However, some brands may add milk powder or whey, so always check labels.
**Check for:** "May contain milk" warnings if processed in shared facilities

---

### Eggs - SAFE (Not Dairy!)
**Status:** ✅ SAFE - Eggs are NOT dairy
**Explanation:** Eggs come from chickens, not cows. They are NOT dairy products. This is a common misconception.
**Important:** People with milk allergy CAN eat eggs (unless they also have a separate egg allergy)

---

### Dark Chocolate - DEPENDS (Check Labels)
**Status:** ⚠️ Check carefully
**Explanation:** Pure dark chocolate should only contain cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and sugar (no milk). However, many dark chocolate products in the UK contain milk powder or are made in facilities with milk chocolate.
**Safe options:**
- Dark chocolate labeled "dairy-free" or "vegan"
- Check for "may contain milk" warnings
**Unsafe:**
- Milk chocolate (contains milk powder/solids)
- White chocolate (contains milk)
- Many UK chocolate bars (even dark ones may contain milk)

---

### Bread - DEPENDS (Often Contains Milk)
**Status:** ⚠️ Check labels carefully
**Explanation:** Many UK breads contain milk powder as a dough improver/conditioner. Some are dairy-free.
**Check labels for:**
- Milk powder, Dried milk
- Whey powder
- Butter, Buttermilk
**Usually safe:**
- Plain baguettes, Ciabatta (Italian-style)
- Sourdough (check labels)
- Pitta bread (most brands)
- Many supermarket "Free From" breads

---

### Margarine - DEPENDS (Check Labels)
**Status:** ⚠️ Check carefully
**Explanation:** Margarine is typically plant-based, but some brands contain milk derivatives (whey, buttermilk, lactose) for flavour or texture.
**Dairy-free brands (UK):**
- Vitalite, Pure, Flora Plant
**May contain dairy:**
- Some traditional margarine brands
**Always check:** Ingredient labels for milk derivatives

---

### Wine and Beer - USUALLY SAFE (But Check)
**Status:** ✅ USUALLY SAFE (with cautions)
**Explanation:** Most wine and beer are dairy-free. However, some are clarified/fined using milk products (casein) or isinglass (fish). Small amounts may remain.
**Check for:**
- "Vegan" labeled wines and beers (guaranteed no animal products)
- Milk stouts, Cream stouts (contain lactose - UNSAFE)
- Some cask ales (may use isinglass but no dairy)
**Unsafe:**
- Milk stouts (e.g., Mackeson - contains lactose)
- Cream liqueurs (e.g., Baileys - contains cream)

---

### Kosher Pareve Products - OFTEN SAFE
**Status:** ✅ Often safe for dairy avoidance
**Explanation:** In kosher dietary law, "pareve" (or "parve") means the product contains neither meat nor dairy. These products should be dairy-free.
**Look for:** "Pareve" or "Parve" label on kosher products
**Caution:** Always check ingredients as kosher standards differ from allergen-free standards

---

### Vegan Products - SAFE
**Status:** ✅ SAFE - Vegan means no animal products
**Explanation:** Products labeled "vegan" contain NO animal products, including NO dairy. They are safe for milk allergy.
**Look for:** "Vegan" or "Suitable for Vegans" labels
**UK Vegan labels:** Certified Vegan, The Vegan Society trademark

---

### "May Contain Milk" Warnings - CAUTION
**Status:** ⚠️ Use caution based on allergy severity
**Explanation:** "May contain milk" or "Made in a facility that also processes milk" indicates possible cross-contamination, not intentional milk ingredients.
**For this app:** Flag these warnings and let the user decide based on their allergy severity
**Severe allergy:** Avoid products with these warnings
**Mild allergy:** May tolerate trace cross-contamination (user discretion)

---

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's a dairy derivative**
- Does the name contain "milk", "whey", "casein", "lacto-", "butter" (except cocoa/shea/peanut butter)?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for dairy allergy

**Step 2: Check if it's a processed product**
- Is it a sauce, baked good, processed meat, chocolate, or convenience food?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain dairy - check labels"

**Step 3: Check if it's a natural whole food**
- Is it a fresh vegetable, fruit, meat, fish, nut, seed, or grain?
- If YES → Usually SAFE (unless processed with dairy)

**Step 4: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about food chemistry and dairy ingredients
- Research the ingredient's typical composition
- Consider UK labeling requirements (milk is a major allergen)

**Step 5: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain dairy - please verify the label or choose a certified dairy-free version"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

---

### Safety Principles for Dairy:

1. **Always check processed foods** - Dairy hides in many unexpected places
2. **Lactose-free is NOT dairy-free** - Critical distinction for milk allergy
3. **Eggs are NOT dairy** - Common misconception to correct
4. **UK labels are reliable** - Milk must be highlighted in bold on UK food packaging
5. **Cross-contamination matters** - Mention if shared equipment could be an issue
6. **Vegan = Dairy-free** - Products labeled vegan are safe for milk allergy
