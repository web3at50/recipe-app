# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - SOY/SOYA

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common soy/soya-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines and Allergy UK resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for soy/soya-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about soy/soya derivatives
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain soy/soya - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Soy/Soya?

Soy (US spelling) / Soya (UK spelling) refers to soybeans (Glycine max) and products derived from them. Soya is one of the **14 major allergens** that must be declared under UK food law.

**Prevalence:** Soya allergy is most common in infants and young children, though it can occur at any age. Many children outgrow it by age 10.

**Where it hides:** Soya is found in approximately **60% of manufactured foods** in the UK, making it one of the most difficult allergens to avoid.

**UK Terminology:**
- **"Soya"** is the standard UK spelling (used on UK food labels)
- **"Soy"** is the US spelling (but also appears on UK products)
- Both refer to the same allergen

For this app, treat all soy/soya allergies as requiring strict avoidance unless specifically advised otherwise by a healthcare professional.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Soya Lecithin (E322) - OFTEN TOLERATED

**Status:** ⚠️ May be safe for MANY people with soya allergy
**Explanation:** Soya lecithin is a highly refined emulsifier derived from soya beans. Most people with soya allergy can tolerate soya lecithin because it contains **very little soya protein** (the allergenic component).

**UK Guidance:**
- Allergy UK states: "Most people with soya allergy can tolerate soya lecithin"
- NHS guidance: "You may be able to tolerate soya lecithin... ask your dietitian for specific advice"
- Individual tolerance varies - some people react, most don't

**Where Found:**
- Chocolate (very common)
- Baked goods
- Margarine
- Processed foods as emulsifier
- Listed as "E322" or "lecithin (soya)"

**Recommendation for App:**
- Flag as: "Contains soya lecithin (E322). Many people with soya allergy can tolerate this, but individual tolerance varies. Consult with your healthcare provider."
- Allow users to customize if they can tolerate lecithin

---

### Refined Soya Oil - USUALLY SAFE

**Status:** ✅ SAFE for most people with soya allergy
**Explanation:** Fully refined soya oil has the soya protein removed during the refining process. The UK Food Standards Agency advises that refined soya oil should be safe for people with soya allergy.

**UK Regulatory Status:**
- Fully refined soya oil is **exempt from allergen declaration** under UK law
- This means products can contain refined soya oil without declaring "soya" on the label

**Safe:**
- Refined soya oil (fully refined)
- Products containing refined soya oil

**UNSAFE:**
- Cold-pressed soya oil (contains protein - MUST be declared)
- Unrefined soya oil
- Crude soya oil

**Where Found:**
- Vegetable oil blends
- Cooking oils
- Fried foods
- Margarine and spreads
- Salad dressings

**Problem for Users:**
- If a product contains only refined soya oil, it won't say "soya" on the label
- Difficult to track

**Recommendation for App:**
- If user can tolerate refined soya oil: Accept recipes with "vegetable oil" or "refined soya oil"
- If user cannot tolerate ANY soya oil: Flag "vegetable oil" as potentially problematic and suggest specific oils (olive, rapeseed, sunflower)

---

### Edamame = Soybeans - UNSAFE

**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - these ARE soybeans!
**Explanation:** Edamame are immature green soybeans, eaten whole in their pods. They are pure soya and highly allergenic.

**Common Confusion:**
- Many people don't realize edamame are soybeans
- UK labeling requires: "edamame (soya)" to make this clear
- Often served in Japanese restaurants as appetizers

**Where Found:**
- Japanese restaurants
- Sushi restaurants
- Asian cuisine
- Frozen vegetable mixes
- Salads
- Snacks

**Recommendation for App:**
- Always flag edamame as containing soya
- Suggest alternatives: garden peas, broad beans, chickpeas

---

### Tamari vs Soy Sauce - BOTH CONTAIN SOYA

**Status:** ❌ BOTH UNSAFE for soya allergy
**Explanation:**
- **Soy sauce** = fermented soybeans + wheat + salt
- **Tamari** = fermented soybeans + salt (usually no wheat)
- Tamari is gluten-free but NOT soya-free!

**Common Confusion:**
- People think "tamari" is a safe alternative to soy sauce
- It's only safe for GLUTEN allergies, NOT soya allergies
- Both contain high levels of soya protein

**Recommendation for App:**
- Flag both soy sauce AND tamari as containing soya
- Suggest: Coconut aminos (soy-free, gluten-free alternative)

---

### "Vegetable Oil" - MAY CONTAIN SOYA

**Status:** ⚠️ DEPENDS on source and refining
**Explanation:** In the UK, "vegetable oil" on a label can be a blend of different oils, potentially including soya oil.

**If fully refined:** Usually safe (see refined soya oil section above)
**If cold-pressed or unrefined:** Would need to declare soya

**Problem:**
- Label just says "vegetable oil" with no specifics
- May be rapeseed, sunflower, soya, or a blend
- If it's refined soya oil, it won't be declared

**Recommendation for App:**
- If user is VERY sensitive or avoids all soya: Flag "vegetable oil" as potentially containing soya, suggest specific oils (olive oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil)
- If user can tolerate refined soya oil: Accept "vegetable oil"

---

### Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP) - USUALLY SOYA

**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - almost always soya
**Explanation:** TVP is usually made from defatted soya flour, though technically it could be from other sources.

**Where Found:**
- Vegetarian products
- Meat extenders
- Processed meat products
- Veggie burgers and sausages

**Recommendation for App:**
- Always flag TVP as containing soya unless specifically stated otherwise

---

### Worcestershire Sauce - CHECK BRAND

**Status:** ⚠️ Some brands contain soya, some don't
**Explanation:** Traditional Worcestershire sauce contains tamarind, vinegar, molasses, and anchovies, but many modern brands add soya sauce or soya protein.

**Common UK Brands:**
- **Lea & Perrins Original:** Contains soya (check current label)
- **Henderson's Relish:** Soy-free (Sheffield alternative)
- **Store brands:** Check labels - varies

**Recommendation for App:**
- Flag Worcestershire sauce as "may contain soya - check brand"
- Suggest Henderson's Relish as soy-free alternative

---

### Miso, Tempeh, Natto - ALL SOYA

**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - all made from soybeans
**Explanation:** These are fermented soya products:
- **Miso** = fermented soya bean paste (Japanese)
- **Tempeh** = fermented whole soya beans (Indonesian)
- **Natto** = fermented soya beans (Japanese)

**Common Confusion:**
- Fermentation doesn't remove the allergen
- These are pure soya products

**Recommendation for App:**
- Always flag these as containing soya
- No safe alternatives that replicate these flavors

---

### UK Spelling: Soya vs Soy

**Status:** ℹ️ Information - same allergen, different spelling
**Explanation:**
- **"Soya"** is the standard UK spelling
- **"Soy"** is the US spelling
- UK food labels typically use "soya"
- Both refer to the same allergen

**For App Development:**
- Search for both spellings when checking ingredients
- Pattern match for: "soy", "soya", "soja" (some European products)

---

### Bean Curd = Tofu = SOYA

**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - these are the same product
**Explanation:** Bean curd is another name for tofu, which is made from soya beans.

**Other Names for Tofu:**
- Bean curd
- Soya curd
- Doufu (Chinese)

**Recommendation for App:**
- Flag all of these as containing soya

---

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's a direct soya derivative**
- Does the name contain "soy", "soya", "soja", "edamame", "tofu", "miso", "tempeh"?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for soya

**Step 2: Check if it's a processed product**
- Is it a sauce, gravy, processed meat, ready meal, or convenience food?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain soya - check labels" (60% of processed foods contain soya)

**Step 3: Check if it's a vegetarian/vegan product**
- Is it a meat alternative, vegan cheese, or plant-based protein?
- If YES → Flag as "likely contains soya - check labels" (most vegan products use soya)

**Step 4: Check if it's a natural whole food**
- Is it a fresh vegetable, fruit, meat, fish, egg, or dairy?
- If YES → Usually SAFE (unless processed)

**Step 5: Check for "vegetable" terminology**
- Does it say "vegetable oil", "vegetable protein", "vegetable fat"?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain soya - check source"

**Step 6: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about soya usage in food production
- Research the ingredient's typical composition

**Step 7: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain soya - please verify the label or choose a soya-free alternative"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

---

### Safety Principles for Soya:

1. **Soya is everywhere** - Found in 60% of UK processed foods, assume processed foods contain soya unless labeled otherwise
2. **Check ALL processed foods** - Soya protein is a cheap filler/extender
3. **Asian cuisine is high-risk** - Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai cuisines heavily use soya sauce, tofu, miso
4. **Vegetarian/vegan products almost always contain soya** - It's the primary plant protein
5. **Fresh/natural is usually safe** - Fresh meat, fish, dairy, fruits, vegetables are soya-free
6. **UK labels are reliable** - Soya must be declared (except fully refined soya oil)
7. **Lecithin and refined oil are often tolerated** - But individual tolerance varies
8. **"Vegetable" is a red flag** - Could mean soya (vegetable oil, vegetable protein, vegetable fat)
