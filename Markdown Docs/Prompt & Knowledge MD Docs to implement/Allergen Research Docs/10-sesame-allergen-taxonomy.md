# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - SESAME

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common sesame-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines, Allergy UK, and NHS resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for sesame-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about sesame and seed-based products
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain sesame - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious
6. **Remember:** Just one or two sesame seeds can trigger a severe allergic reaction

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Sesame Allergy?

Sesame (Sesamum indicum) is one of the 14 major allergens that must be declared on food labels in the UK. Sesame allergy can cause:
- **Mild reactions** (skin rashes, hives, itching)
- **Moderate reactions** (digestive issues, swelling)
- **Severe reactions** (anaphylaxis - life-threatening)

Sesame allergy is just as serious as peanut allergy and should be treated with the same level of caution.

**Important:** Unlike peanut oil (which is often refined to remove allergens), sesame oil is cold-pressed and unrefined, meaning it **retains allergenicity** and can cause reactions.

**Other Names for Sesame:**
- Benne, Benne seed
- Gingelly, Gingelly oil
- Til, Teel
- Simsim
- Ajonjoli
- Sesamol, Sesamolina
- Sesamum indicum (Latin name in cosmetics)

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Tahini - ALWAYS Contains Sesame
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - pure sesame
**Explanation:** Tahini is made by grinding sesame seeds into a paste. It is 100% sesame. If a product contains tahini, it is NOT safe for sesame allergy.
**Common in:** Traditional hummus, halva, baba ganoush, Middle Eastern sauces
**Safe Alternative:** Sunflower seed butter (similar consistency and nutritional profile)

---

### Hummus - USUALLY Contains Sesame (via Tahini)
**Status:** ⚠️ UNSAFE unless specifically labeled sesame-free
**Explanation:** Traditional hummus is made with chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic. The tahini makes it unsafe.
**Safe Options:**
- Hummus made with sunflower seed butter instead of tahini
- Check label for "tahini-free" or "sesame-free" designation
- Make your own with sunflower seed butter
**UK Brands:** Some UK supermarkets now stock tahini-free hummus - always check labels

---

### Halva - ALWAYS Contains Sesame
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - pure sesame
**Explanation:** Halva (also spelled halvah, halawa) is a Middle Eastern sweet made primarily from tahini (sesame paste) and sugar. It is NOT safe for sesame allergy.
**No Safe Alternative:** There is no direct substitute - it's fundamentally a sesame product

---

### Bagels - OFTEN Have Sesame Seeds
**Status:** ⚠️ Check carefully
**Explanation:**
- "Everything bagels" typically have sesame seeds in the topping
- Many plain bagels have sesame seeds on top
- Even "plain" bagels from bakeries may be cross-contaminated
**Safe Options:**
- Specifically labeled sesame-free bagels
- Bagels with alternative toppings (poppy seed, plain, onion-only)
- Check labels carefully or ask bakery staff

---

### Burger Buns - OFTEN Have Sesame Seeds
**Status:** ⚠️ Check carefully
**Explanation:** Traditional burger buns often have sesame seeds baked on top
**Safe Options:**
- Plain burger buns (check label)
- Brioche buns without sesame
- Alternative buns (ciabatta, sourdough)
**Restaurant Warning:** Always ask if burger buns have sesame seeds - many do

---

### Sesame Oil - HIGHLY ALLERGENIC
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - retains allergens
**Explanation:** Unlike peanut oil (which is often refined), sesame oil is typically cold-pressed and unrefined, meaning it retains sesame proteins that trigger allergic reactions.
**Hidden Risk:** May be labeled as "vegetable oil" in ingredient lists (UK products)
**Caution:** Used extensively in Asian cooking - always ask about oils used

---

### "Vegetable Oil" - MAY Contain Sesame
**Status:** ⚠️ Check source in UK
**Explanation:** In the UK, "vegetable oil" can include sesame oil. Under UK law, if sesame is used, it must be declared, but wording can be "vegetable oil (sesame)" which is easy to miss.
**Safe Practice:**
- Check label carefully for "(sesame)" after "vegetable oil"
- If dining out, ask what oils are used
- Stick to specifically labeled oils (olive, sunflower, rapeseed)

---

### Falafel - SOMETIMES Contains Sesame
**Status:** ⚠️ Check ingredients
**Explanation:** Traditional falafel is chickpea-based and sesame-free, but some recipes add tahini or sesame seeds for flavor and binding.
**Safe Practice:** Always check ingredients or ask if tahini/sesame is used

---

### Baba Ganoush - OFTEN Contains Tahini
**Status:** ⚠️ UNSAFE unless confirmed sesame-free
**Explanation:** Baba ganoush is a Middle Eastern dip made from roasted aubergine (eggplant). Many recipes include tahini.
**Safe Practice:** Always check if tahini is used - if yes, avoid

---

### Japanese Cuisine - Watch for Goma/Gomashio
**Status:** ⚠️ UNSAFE - sesame products
**Explanation:**
- **Goma** = Japanese word for sesame
- **Gomashio** = Sesame salt (ground sesame with salt)
- Widely used in Japanese cooking
**Watch For:** Goma dressing, goma dofu (sesame tofu), dishes with "goma" in the name

---

### Za'atar and Dukkah - Usually Contain Sesame
**Status:** ⚠️ UNSAFE in most cases
**Explanation:**
- **Za'atar** = Middle Eastern spice blend (often contains sesame seeds)
- **Dukkah** = Egyptian nut and seed blend (typically contains sesame)
**Safe Practice:** Assume unsafe unless specifically labeled sesame-free

---

### Cross-Contamination Risk - Sesame Seeds are "Sticky"
**Status:** ⚠️ High cross-contamination risk
**Explanation:** Sesame seeds become electrostatic and cling to charged surfaces including:
- Other foods
- Clothing
- Equipment
- Countertops
**High Risk Environments:**
- Bakeries (especially if they use sesame on any products)
- Restaurants (shared cooking equipment)
- Unwrapped bakery counters
**Safe Practice:** Ask about dedicated equipment or cross-contamination procedures

---

### Bread Products - Check Even "Plain" Varieties
**Status:** ⚠️ May contain hidden sesame
**Explanation:** Some bread has sesame seeds hidden in the dough or sprinkled on top. Bakery cross-contamination is common.
**Safe Practice:**
- Read labels on packaged bread
- Ask bakery staff about ingredients AND cross-contamination
- Look for "sesame-free" or "made in sesame-free facility"

### Safety Principles for Sesame:

1. **Sesame oil is NOT refined** - Unlike peanut oil, it retains allergens and is UNSAFE
2. **Cross-contamination is high** - Sesame seeds are electrostatic and stick to everything
3. **Check all bread products** - Even plain bread may have sesame
4. **Tahini = sesame paste** - If it contains tahini, it contains sesame
5. **Traditional hummus has tahini** - Assume unsafe unless labeled tahini-free
6. **"Vegetable oil" may include sesame** - Check labels carefully in UK
7. **Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines use sesame heavily** - Always ask about ingredients
8. **Just 1-2 seeds can cause a reaction** - Take trace amounts seriously
9. **Restaurant staff may not understand severity** - Be explicit about allergy risk
