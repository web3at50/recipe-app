Need to sort out allergens

1: Sort out what happens when enter milk when milk is an allergen - nicer exit. Works for when  one recipe selected but ugly on all 4

2: need to figure out how to handle coconut milk being entered as ingredient and being blocked when milk is the allergen (might have to leave this as quirk)

3: Better solution that allergen showing in recipe card when coconut milk added as entred in description

4: british, Indian. Chinese etc image showing in my-recipes
