# ALLERGEN TAXONOMY - GLUTEN

---

## How to Use This Taxonomy

**For AI Models:**
This taxonomy provides comprehensive coverage of common gluten-containing foods based on UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines and Coeliac UK resources. However, it cannot list every possible food product or ingredient.

**Instructions:**
1. Use this taxonomy as your **primary reference** for gluten-containing foods
2. If an ingredient IS listed → follow the classification (unsafe or safe)
3. If an ingredient is NOT listed → apply your general knowledge about gluten-containing grains
4. If uncertain → flag it with "may contain gluten - please verify" rather than assuming it's safe
5. **Safety is paramount** → when in doubt, be cautious

**Remember:** This is a guide to help you, not a limitation on your knowledge. Combine this reference with your training data for best results.

## Background: What is Gluten?

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives. It causes immune reactions in people with:
- **Coeliac disease** (autoimmune condition - serious)
- **Wheat allergy** (allergic reaction)
- **Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity** (digestive issues)

For this app, treat all three as requiring strict gluten avoidance.

## ⚠️ TRICKY CASES - Important Notes

### Buckwheat - SAFE (Despite the Name!)
**Status:** ✅ SAFE for gluten allergies
**Explanation:** Buckwheat is NOT wheat at all - it's a seed from the rhubarb family. The name is misleading. Buckwheat flour, buckwheat noodles (soba), and buckwheat groats are all gluten-free.
**Caution:** Some soba noodles are mixed with wheat flour - check labels.

---

### Oats - COMPLICATED (Usually Safe, But...)
**Status:** ⚠️ SAFE if certified gluten-free, UNSAFE otherwise
**Explanation:** Oats are naturally gluten-free BUT often contaminated during growing, harvesting, or processing with wheat/barley/rye.
**Safe Options:**
- Certified gluten-free oats (Nairn's, Rude Health, Mornflake Gluten-Free)
- Labeled "gluten-free" in UK
**Unsafe:** Regular oats from regular supermarket aisles

---

### Malt - UNSAFE (Contains Barley)
**Status:** ❌ UNSAFE - contains gluten
**Explanation:** Malt is made from barley. Malt extract, malt vinegar, malted barley, and "malt flavoring" all contain gluten.
**Common Products:** Malt vinegar (chips), malted milk drinks, some cereals

---

### Wheat-Free vs Gluten-Free - NOT THE SAME
**Important:** "Wheat-free" does NOT mean gluten-free
**Explanation:** A product can be wheat-free but still contain barley or rye (which have gluten)
**Always look for:** "Gluten-free" label, NOT just "wheat-free"

---

### Modified Food Starch - DEPENDS
**Status:** ⚠️ Check source
**Explanation:** In the UK, if modified food starch is from wheat, it must be declared
**If label says:** "Modified maize starch" or "Modified corn starch" → Safe
**If label says:** "Modified food starch (wheat)" → Unsafe
**If label just says:** "Modified food starch" → In UK, usually safe (would specify if wheat), but if uncertain, flag it

---

### Cross-Contamination Warnings
**Items that MAY be contaminated:**
- Regular oats (as mentioned)
- Foods processed in facilities that also process wheat
- Shared fryers (chips cooked with battered fish)
- Shared toasters, cutting boards

**For this app:** If user has gluten allergy, recommend:
- Certified gluten-free oats only
- Separate cooking equipment where possible
- Check labels for "may contain" warnings

---

### UK-Specific Confusions

**Cornflour vs Corn Flour:**
- Cornflour (UK) = Cornstarch (US) = ✅ Gluten-free
- Corn flour (US) = Polenta/cornmeal = ✅ Gluten-free
- Both are safe - just terminology differences

**Chips (UK) = Fries (US):**
- Plain potato chips = ✅ Safe
- BUT battered chips or shared fryer with battered fish = ❌ Cross-contaminated

## 🤖 AI GUIDANCE - For Edge Cases

### When You Encounter an Ingredient NOT Listed Above:

**Step 1: Check if it's a grain derivative**
- Does the name contain "wheat", "barley", "rye", "malt"?
- If YES → Flag as UNSAFE for gluten

**Step 2: Check if it's a processed product**
- Is it a sauce, gravy, processed meat, or convenience food?
- If YES → Flag as "may contain gluten - check labels"

**Step 3: Check if it's a natural whole food**
- Is it a fresh vegetable, fruit, meat, fish, egg, nut, or seed?
- If YES → Usually SAFE (unless processed/breaded)

**Step 4: Apply your training knowledge**
- Use what you know about food chemistry and grain composition
- Research the ingredient's typical composition

**Step 5: When uncertain**
- Flag it as: "This ingredient may contain gluten - please verify the label or use a certified gluten-free version"
- Better to be cautious than risk harm

---

### Safety Principles for Gluten:

1. **Always check processed foods** - Gluten hides in unexpected places
2. **Pure/natural is usually safe** - Fresh, whole foods are typically gluten-free
3. **Grains need verification** - If it's a grain, check the taxonomy or your knowledge
4. **Cross-contamination matters** - Mention if shared equipment could be an issue
5. **UK labels are reliable** - In the UK, gluten-containing ingredients must be declared

### Examples of Good AI Behavior:

**Example 1: Item in Taxonomy**
```
User ingredient: "Soy sauce"
Taxonomy says: Contains wheat - UNSAFE
AI action: Flag allergen conflict, suggest tamari as alternative
✅ Correct
```

**Example 2: Item NOT in Taxonomy**
```
User ingredient: "Seitan"
Taxonomy: Not listed
AI knowledge: Seitan is pure wheat gluten
AI action: Flag as UNSAFE even though not explicitly listed
✅ Correct - used own knowledge
```

**Example 3: Uncertain Item**
```
User ingredient: "Ancient grain blend"
Taxonomy: Not listed
AI knowledge: Could be anything
AI action: Flag as "may contain gluten - please specify the exact grains"
✅ Correct - asked for clarification rather than assuming
```

**Example 4: False Positive Avoided**
```
User ingredient: "Buckwheat flour"
Taxonomy: Listed as SAFE (despite name)
AI action: Use buckwheat flour, don't flag as gluten
✅ Correct - followed taxonomy's tricky cases section
```
