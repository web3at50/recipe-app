# Allergen Safety & Recipe Information

## Important Notice About Allergen Information

**PlateWise provides AI-generated recipes for informational and inspirational purposes only.** While we make every effort to accurately detect and label allergens in our recipes, we cannot guarantee completeness or accuracy.

## Your Responsibility

### Before Using Any Recipe:

✓ **Always check ingredient labels** - Manufacturers may change formulations without notice
✓ **Verify allergen information** on every product you purchase
✓ **Consult your healthcare provider** for serious allergies or dietary restrictions
✓ **Cross-contamination** - Be aware of potential cross-contact during manufacturing and preparation
✓ **Ingredient substitutions** - Any changes you make may introduce allergens not listed in the original recipe

## How We Detect Allergens

Our system uses AI technology to detect allergens in recipes based on the 14 major UK allergens:

- Cereals containing gluten
- Crustaceans (shellfish)
- Eggs
- Fish
- Peanuts
- Soybeans (soya)
- Milk (dairy)
- Tree nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, etc.)
- Celery
- Mustard
- Sesame
- Sulphites
- Lupin
- Molluscs

**However:** AI detection has limitations and may not identify:
- Hidden allergens in processed ingredients
- Allergens in specific product brands or formulations
- Cross-contamination during manufacturing
- Allergens introduced through ingredient substitutions
- New or modified product formulations

## Best Practices for Food Allergy Safety

1. **Keep it simple** - The fewer ingredients, the easier to verify safety
2. **Whole foods first** - Fresh, unprocessed ingredients are easier to identify
3. **When in doubt, leave it out** - If you're unsure about an ingredient, don't use it
4. **Read every label, every time** - Even familiar products may change
5. **Watch for "may contain" warnings** - These indicate potential cross-contamination
6. **Ask questions** - Contact manufacturers if allergen information is unclear
