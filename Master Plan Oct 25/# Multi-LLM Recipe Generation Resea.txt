# Multi-LLM Recipe Generation Research Project

## Context
We are developing a recipe generation application where AI-generated recipe quality is the core differentiator. User research has identified that existing recipe apps produce unsafe and poor-quality results. Our unique selling proposition (USP) will be offering recipes generated by multiple AI providers, giving users options rather than a single output.

## Current State
- Active API keys configured (local and Vercel): OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY
- Existing prompt engineering improvements implemented
- Reference document: `C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25\Focused_MVP_Product_Strategy_2025.md` (particularly line 1161 regarding Anthropic Claude Memory Tool)

## Research Objectives

### Primary Decision
Determine whether to implement:
1. **Option A**: Vercel AI Gateway (unified integration)
2. **Option B**: Direct API integrations with individual providers
3. **Option C**: Hybrid approach (Gateway + direct integrations)

### Research Requirements

Create a comprehensive analysis covering:

#### 1. Vercel AI Gateway Analysis
- Complete feature set and capabilities
- Pricing structure and cost implications
- Rate limits and quotas
- Observability and monitoring tools
- BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) functionality
- Framework integration options
- Model switching capabilities
- Image generation support (for recipe images)
- Authentication and security
- Pros and cons for our multi-provider use case

#### 2. OpenAI Provider Analysis
- Model recommendations from: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1-nano
- Quality assessment for recipe generation (detail, accuracy, safety, creativity)
- Pricing per model (cost per 1K tokens input/output)
- Rate limits and quotas
- Token limits and context windows
- Special features relevant to recipe generation
- Integration complexity (direct API vs Gateway)

**Documentation:** https://platform.openai.com/docs/models

#### 3. Anthropic Claude Analysis
- Available models and recommendations
- Deep dive on **Claude Memory Tool** (line 1161 reference) - how it works, benefits for recipe generation, implementation requirements
- Quality assessment for recipe generation
- Pricing structure
- Rate limits and quotas
- Context window sizes
- Unique features vs competitors
- Integration complexity

**Documentation:** https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview

#### 4. Google Gemini Analysis
- Available models and recommendations
- Quality assessment for recipe generation
- Pricing tiers (including paid account features)
- Rate limits and quotas
- OpenAI compatibility layer
- API libraries and SDKs
- Unique capabilities
- Integration complexity

## Specific Analysis Requirements

For each provider/model combination, evaluate:

### Quality Metrics
- Recipe coherence and logical flow
- Ingredient safety and compatibility
- Cooking instruction clarity and accuracy
- Creativity and variety in output
- Handling of dietary restrictions
- Nutritional information accuracy

### Cost Analysis
- Per-recipe generation cost estimates
- Monthly cost projections (low/medium/high usage scenarios)
- Potential tiered pricing for customers based on model selection

### Technical Considerations
- Response time/latency
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Ease of implementation and maintenance
- Scalability

## Deliverables

Create separate markdown reports for each research area:

1. `Vercel_AI_Gateway_Analysis.md`
2. `OpenAI_Provider_Analysis.md`
3. `Anthropic_Claude_Analysis.md` (include dedicated section on Memory Tool)
4. `Google_Gemini_Analysis.md`
5. `Comparative_Summary_and_Recommendations.md` (synthesis of all findings)

**Output location:** `C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25\Multiple AI\`

## Report Structure (for each document)

```markdown
# [Provider/Gateway Name] Analysis

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraph overview of key findings]

## Features and Capabilities
[Detailed breakdown]

## Pricing Analysis
[Include tables with cost breakdowns]

## Quality Assessment for Recipe Generation
[Specific to our use case]

## Rate Limits and Quotas
