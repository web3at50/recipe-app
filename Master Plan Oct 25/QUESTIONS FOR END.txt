.6to do in recipe app

1: We need this on the home page before auth. Users need to be able to try for free first (within limits). I believe this was in C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25\Focused_MVP_Product_Strategy_2025.md   Can you please review?  Can you assign a specialist agent to research and investigate and plan how we could implement this. Including how we allow users to have a good opportunity to use our app for free but not so good that they don't need to ever pay the one off purchase price (whatever that is we agree on). Remember our model is not subscription but instead a one off fee of £9.99 to £14.99 (undecided). This was part of our original plan to be different from others and avoid the subscription fee. How will be deal with natasha law and preferences on free to use pre auth version? What features other than ai recipe generation do we enable on the free pre auth version.  The agent needs to be a specialist research agent   in the field of app development like ours

Natasha law on testing

2: When signed in user_profiles table from onboarding go to the account section

3: Can we add pref for no dairy and keto etc somewhere (later phase

4: GDPR is mentioned in onboarding but d we need a page?

5: Natasha allergy law - page for that to look professional and maybe mention in onboarding again to look pro

6: Payment - one off how much? How to protect against nailing the AI too much. How to protect if users use forever and new ones stop coming In so paying maintenance forever with no new fees?  Annual subs? Ideas? I do like simplicity of non subscription model certainly monthly. One off fee is good for appeal to users but do I need some protection

7: Make sure we have claude 4.5 sonnet memory game changer apparently. Mentioned in C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25\Focused_MVP_Product_Strategy_2025.md line 1161

8: AI Gateway so users can try multiple LLM to see which best. Multiple LLM on free version and cost is based on which ones / how many subscribe to

9: IMage in recipes - whats the plan here? How to add ?  AI / customer / remove ? Plan?

10: From week 5 enhancements to add

- [ ] Drag-and-drop to reorder meals between days
- [ ] Duplicate meal to another day

11: mobile !!!!

12: Make all available without signin and navigate nicely.  Don't know how will work without sign in to save to persona databases etc ?

13: Amend icons - hate sparkle from lucide react - better libraries?

14: App name & logo

15: What extras from p2 and p3 should we add for easy wins wins

16: WhatsApp shopping list . Email to - email easy probably but WhatsApp if possible better. Or if we make the app mobile friendly they just use the app ! Male a whole mobile version of shopping ist page for mobile so super user friendly

17: generate recipes and shopping ist in pdf to  print

18: Recipes look great on mobile to read and use live in kitchen

18: Investigate and sort pantry list option on shopping list screen

19: Add C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25 to gitignore and then delete from githb

20: Doesn't need to incoude all ingredients
