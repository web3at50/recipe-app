 - Make mobile friendly as this is where most will use. Some bits are some bits aren't. Should be do this as we go or all at the end ?  Pages but also recipes and meal planners and shopping lists as will all mainly be used on mobile

 - Natasha law page and link to from onboarding flow. Need to create page and write content and link to from onboarding flow

 - Need to understand where preferences of users are being saved and how can I check are correct.  We started with supabase auth and migrated to Clerk auth so need to make sure all is working.  How can we test?  Should we delete all user information from (its only my test data anyway) and start again so I an gain understanding of whats going where and make sure works?  We also need to add preferences to the users front end account in the auth sde so they can view/edit/delete/amend etc . These are in supabase as I have checked. I just need to know how to get user_if in website to match against supabase user_341353sZs3wpmTkPzxGPb5qiEAd in user_id column in user_profiles table

- Preferences editable on recipe creation  page and in setting above

 - Need to add additional diet preferences facility into onboarding and  like low carb, keto, no dairy (other ?). Step 2 in onboarding Dietary Preferences. So they get put into ai generation prompts etc too

- Existing logic include pantry items?  Add a togglr for what ingredients are and are not included in logig (prompt)

-  We need Privacy/GDPR page and link to from onboarding (just create holding page for now)


- Pricing plan to be decided

- What plan with the image section in the my recipe page  Was there one? We could maybe use below. See if any good before decide if and how to add

Gemini 2.5 Flash Image - mentioned in C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25\Multiple AI\Google_Gemini_Analysis.md 
page - https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation



- Create 3 recipes at once - one per model - display in a way user can scroll through to see which model they prefer


- Maybe later enhacements to meal plan

[ ] Drag-and-drop to reorder meals between days
[ ] Duplicate meal to another day



- Work on pre auth side - do last I think

- Amend icons - hate sparkle from lucide react - better libraries?

- App logo. Favicon okay but main logo didn't really work so look at again

- Add pdf shift for pdf generation in the recipe page - have already added PDF_SHIFT_API_KEY to local.env and vercel env variables

https://docs.pdfshift.io/#introduction



- What are user_recipe_interactions table in supabase as only table with 0



- What extras from p2 and p3 from C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25\Focused_MVP_Product_Strategy_2025.md should we add for easy  wins

- Send shopping list to someone by WhatsApp - if easy and / or cheap. Main thing to do though is make it super user friendly to read on mobile version of our app



- Add C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25 to gitignore and then delete from githb

- Double check logic in ai recipe generation isn't forcing recipe to include ALL ingredients given by user. Can just use some as the end meal result is most important not using all the selected ingredients


- Add grok 4 fast reasoning 

https://docs.x.ai/docs/overview 

C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25\Ad Hoc 13 Oct 2025\Alternative_LLM_Research.md


 - We are using textarea for natural language input in the optional Description field in the ai recipe generation. Could we use something from vercel ai sdk instead as we have it installed already I believe? (give screenshot of docs) . Maybe even something from openAI latest announcements? Isnt textarea quite very basic?


- What does personalized recommendations do on the onboard process? Active yet or just as precaution should be add

 - Need to sort google search console and sitemap and bing etc


Will be adding this in later phase 

NOTES

1: Memory

Make sure we have claude 4.5 sonnet memory game changer apparently. Mentioned in C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25\Focused_MVP_Product_Strategy_2025.md line 1161



2: Add other LLM - Grok is cheap by XAI
