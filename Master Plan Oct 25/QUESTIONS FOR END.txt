to do in recipe app

1: How to use without needing to sign in? Saving preferences etc to database without a sign in ?  Then if and when do create account will saved data transfer over. Onboarding and prefrences infgo etc. Even if free to create account some people wont want to and want a nice simple free to use test on home page without account?

2: When signed in user_profiles table from onboarding go to the account section

3: Can we add pref for no dairy and keto etc somewhere 

4: GDPR is mentioned in onboarding but d we need a page?

5: Natasha allergy law - page for that to look professional and maybe mention in onboarding again to look pro

6: Payment - one off how much? How to protect against nailing the AI too much. How to protect if users use forever and new ones stop coming In so paying maintenance forever with no new fees?  Annual subs? Ideas? I do like simplicity of non subscription model certainly monthly. One off fee is good for appeal to users but do I need some protection

7: Make sure we have claude 4.5 sonnet memory game changer apparently. Mentioned in C:\Users\bryn\Documents\recipeapp\Master Plan Oct 25\Focused_MVP_Product_Strategy_2025.md line 1161

8: AI Gateway so users can try multiple LLM to see which best. Multiple LLM on free version and cost is based on which ones / how many subscribe to

9: IMage in recipes - whats the plan here? How to add ?  AI / customer / remove ? Plan?

10: From week 5 enhancements to add

12: Make all available without signin and navigate nicely.  Don't know how will work without sign in to save to persona databases etc ?

13: Amend icons - hate sparkle from lucide react - better libraries?

14: App name & logo

15: What extras from p2 and p3 should we add for easy wins wins

16: WhatsApp shopping list . Email to - email easy probably but WhatsApp if possible better. Or if we make the app mobile friendly they just use the app ! Male a whole mobile version of shopping ist page for mobile so super user friendly
