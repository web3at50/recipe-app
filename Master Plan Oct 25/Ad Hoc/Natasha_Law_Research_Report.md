## 1. Natasha's Law: Background and Legal Requirements

### 1.1 The Tragic Incident

**Natasha Ednan-Laperouse** was a 15-year-old girl who died on July 17, 2016, after eating an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette purchased from Pret A Manger at Heathrow Airport. The baguette contained sesame seeds baked into the dough, but this ingredient was not listed on the packaging.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **Approximately 30 minutes after takeoff**, Natasha began feeling ill and complained of an itchy throat
- She broke out in hives on her neck and midriff, and her breathing became labored
- Her final words to her father were: **"Daddy please help me I can't breathe"**
- Her father administered two EpiPen injections; a junior doctor on board administered additional epinephrine
- Natasha suffered cardiac arrest and lost consciousness
- She was met by French paramedics upon landing and taken to hospital, where she was pronounced dead

**The Inquest (September 2018):**

- The coroner called Pret a Manger's allergy labelling **"inadequate"**
- It emerged that Pret had received a **"specific warning"** about the dangers of not signposting allergens the previous year
- The tragedy highlighted a critical gap in UK food labelling regulations

### 1.2 Legal Timeline and Implementation

**Key Dates:**

- **July 17, 2016:** Natasha Ednan-Laperouse dies from allergic reaction
- **September 2018:** Inquest concludes, highlighting inadequate allergen labelling
- **2019:** Pret a Manger becomes the first food-to-go business to introduce full ingredient labels on freshly made in-store products
- **July 2019:** New legislation passed
- **October 1, 2021:** Natasha's Law comes into full legal effect across England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland

### 1.3 Official Name and Legal Framework

**Official Designation:**
- The Food Information (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2019
- Commonly known as **"Natasha's Law"**

**Legal Framework:**
- Amends the **Food Information Regulations 2014** (FIR)
- Implements requirements from **retained EU Regulation 1169/2011** on the provision of food information to consumers
- Enforced by local authorities across the UK

### 1.4 Which Businesses It Applies To

Natasha's Law applies to **all food businesses** selling **Prepacked for Direct Sale (PPDS)** foods, regardless of size, including:

- Cafes and coffee shops
- Bakeries
- Delicatessens
- Sandwich bars
- Supermarkets with in-store preparation
- Food stalls and markets
- School and workplace canteens
- Restaurants offering pre-packed items
- Takeaway establishments

**Definition of PPDS:**
Food that is packaged on the same premises from which it is sold, before being ordered or selected by the customer.

### 1.5 Key Requirements for Food Businesses

**Mandatory Label Information:**

1. **Name of the food** - clearly identifying what the product is
2. **Full ingredients list** - every ingredient must be listed
3. **Allergen emphasis** - all 14 major allergens must be emphasized (e.g., in bold, italics, or highlighted) each time they appear in the ingredients list

**Example Format:**
```
Artichoke, Olive & Tapenade Baguette

Ingredients: Wheat flour, water, artichokes (10%), olives (8%),
tapenade (contains SESAME, anchovies (FISH), capers), olive oil,
salt, yeast.

Allergens: Contains WHEAT, SESAME, FISH
```

**Additional Compliance Requirements:**

- Information must be easily visible and clearly legible
- Labels must not be removable or easily damaged
- Staff must be trained on allergen awareness
- Records of ingredients, recipes, and specifications must be maintained
- Risk assessments for cross-contamination must be conducted

### 1.6 The Owen Carey Case and "Owen's Law" Campaign

**Background:**
Owen Carey died on April 22, 2017, at age 18, after eating a Byron burger while celebrating his birthday. He had informed staff of his dairy allergy, but the menu did not indicate that the chicken burger was marinated in buttermilk.

**Coroner's Ruling:**
"The deceased made serving staff aware of his allergies. The menu was reassuring in that it made no reference to any marinade."

**Owen's Law Campaign:**
The Carey family campaigned for restaurants to display **clear allergen information on each individual dish on their menus**, arguing that verbal communication in busy, noisy restaurants with high staff turnover leaves too much room for error.

**Current Status:**
While Owen's Law has not been enacted as legislation, the Food Standards Agency released updated guidance in March 2025 recommending that businesses provide written allergen information for non-prepacked foods through printed menus, allergen charts, posters, or digital resources.

## 2. The 14 Major Food Allergens

The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) recognizes 14 allergens as the most common ingredients that cause food allergies and intolerances. These are listed in Annex II of the Food Information to Consumers (FIC) regulation.

### Complete List with Detailed Descriptions

#### 1. CELERY

**What it includes:**
- Celery stalks
- Celery leaves
- Celery seeds
- Celeriac (celery root)

**Common foods containing celery:**
- Celery salt and seasonings
- Salads and coleslaw
- Meat products (sausages, burgers)
- Soups and broths
- Stock cubes and bouillon
- Vegetable juices

**Why it's a major allergen:**
Celery allergies can cause reactions ranging from mild oral allergy syndrome (itchiness in the throat and mouth) to severe anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals. Celery is often used as a flavoring agent and can be hidden in processed foods.

**Cross-contamination considerations:**
Celery is often processed alongside other vegetables, and celery seeds can contaminate spice mixes.

---

#### 2. CEREALS CONTAINING GLUTEN

**What it includes:**
- Wheat (all varieties including spelt, kamut)
- Rye
- Barley
- Oats
- Their hybridized strains

**Common foods containing gluten:**
- Bread, cakes, and pastries
- Pasta and noodles
- Baking powder and batters
- Breadcrumbs and coatings
- Couscous and bulgur wheat
- Flour (including as a thickener)
- Many processed and fried foods
- Beer and malt vinegar
- Sauces and gravies
- Breakfast cereals

**Why it's a major allergen:**
Gluten-containing cereals can cause:
- **Celiac disease** - an autoimmune condition affecting approximately 1% of the UK population
- **Wheat allergy** - an IgE-mediated allergic reaction
- **Non-celiac gluten sensitivity** - adverse reactions without celiac disease

**Cross-contamination considerations:**
Gluten is extremely difficult to eliminate from shared facilities. Even trace amounts can trigger reactions in celiac disease sufferers. Oats are often cross-contaminated with wheat during processing.

---

#### 3. CRUSTACEANS

**What it includes:**
- Prawns and shrimp
- Crabs
- Lobsters
- Crayfish
- Scampi
- Langoustines

**Common foods containing crustaceans:**
- Seafood dishes and paella
- Asian cuisine (spring rolls, crackers)
- Fish stock and bouillon
- Seafood sauces and pastes
- Some Worcestershire sauces
- Surimi (imitation crab)

**Why it's a major allergen:**
Crustacean allergy is one of the most common food allergies, particularly in adults. Reactions tend to be severe and potentially life-threatening. Notably, allergic reactions can be triggered not just by eating shellfish but also by **airborne proteins released during cooking**, meaning sensitive individuals can react to shellfish cooking vapors.

**Cross-contamination considerations:**
Shellfish proteins are highly allergenic and persistent. Shared fryers, grills, and cooking surfaces pose significant risks. The proteins can become airborne during cooking.

---

#### 4. EGGS

**What it includes:**
- Chicken eggs
- Duck eggs
- Quail eggs
- Goose eggs
- All egg products (whites, yolks, whole eggs)

**Common foods containing eggs:**
- Cakes, biscuits, and pastries
- Mayonnaise and salad dressings
- Mousses and meringues
- Pasta (fresh and some dried)
- Quiche and egg-based dishes
- Sauces (hollandaise, béarnaise)
- Foods brushed or glazed with egg
- Some meat products
- Ice cream and custards
- Marshmallows

**Why it's a major allergen:**
Eggs are **one of the most common foods to trigger allergic symptoms in babies and young children**. According to the NHS, many cases of egg allergy are relatively mild, with symptoms including aggravated asthma and abdominal pain. Most children outgrow egg allergy by school age, but some individuals remain allergic throughout life.

**Cross-contamination considerations:**
Egg proteins can be found in unexpected places. Eggs are used as binding agents, emulsifiers, and glazes. Some vaccines are cultured in eggs (flu vaccine).

---

#### 5. FISH

**What it includes:**
- All types of fish (cod, haddock, salmon, tuna, mackerel, etc.)
- Fish products and derivatives

**Common foods containing fish:**
- Fish sauces (Asian cuisine)
- Worcestershire sauce
- Caesar salad dressing (anchovies)
- Pizza toppings (anchovies)
- Relishes and condiments
- Stock cubes and bouillon
- Surimi (fish-based)
- Some vitamins and supplements (omega-3)

**Why it's a major allergen:**
Fish allergy is typically lifelong and reactions can be severe. Unlike shellfish allergy, fish allergy usually means all fish must be avoided (though some individuals may tolerate certain species). Fish proteins can become airborne during cooking.

**Cross-contamination considerations:**
Fish proteins are highly stable and can contaminate shared cooking equipment, utensils, and surfaces. The smell of fish often indicates airborne proteins that can trigger reactions.

---

#### 6. LUPIN

**What it includes:**
- Lupin beans and seeds

- Some baked goods
- Margarine and vegetable oils
- Processed foods (soy lecithin as emulsifier)

**Why it's a major allergen:**
Soya allergy is common in infants but often outgrown by age 10. However, it can persist into adulthood. Soya is ubiquitous in processed foods, making it challenging to avoid. Some individuals with peanut allergy may also react to soya.

**Cross-contamination considerations:**
Soya derivatives (especially soy lecithin) are found in countless processed foods. Shared processing facilities for legumes are common.

---

#### 13. SULPHUR DIOXIDE AND SULPHITES (above 10mg/kg or 10mg/L)

**What it includes:**
- Sulphur dioxide (SO2)
- Sulphites (E220-E228)
- Sulphating agents used as preservatives

**Common foods containing sulphites:**

- Wine, beer, and cider
- Some fruit juices and soft drinks
- Vinegar and pickled foods
- Processed meat products
- Some vegetables (particularly preserved)
- Grape juice and grape products
- Potato products
- Some seafood (preserved shrimp)

**Why it's a major allergen:**
Sulphur dioxide is **a particular problem for many asthma sufferers**, as it can trigger severe respiratory reactions. While technically a food additive rather than a protein allergen, it can cause serious adverse reactions including breathing difficulties, hives, and anaphylaxis in sensitive individuals.

**Cross-contamination considerations:**
Sulphites are preservatives and less likely to cross-contaminate, but they can be present in unexpected foods like pre-cut potatoes or salad bars.

---

#### 14. TREE NUTS

**What it includes:**
- Almonds
- Hazelnuts (filberts)
- Walnuts
- Brazil nuts
- Cashews

## 3. Application to Digital Food Services and Recipe Apps

### 3.1 Legal Context for Recipe Apps

While **Natasha's Law specifically applies to PPDS foods** (physically packaged and sold from the same premises), digital food services including recipe and meal planning apps operate in a related regulatory environment:

**Applicable Regulations:**
- **Food Information Regulations 2014** - General principles of food information accuracy
- **Consumer Rights Act 2015** - Services must be performed with reasonable care and skill
- **Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR** - For collection and storage of personal health information (allergies)
- **Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008** - Prohibition on misleading information

**Key Principle:**
Recipe apps have a **duty of care** to provide accurate information and not mislead users about allergen content, even though they are not selling physical food products.

### 3.2 Responsibility and Liability Considerations

**Legal Responsibilities:**

1. **Accuracy of Information**
   - Recipe apps must ensure allergen information is accurate and up-to-date
   - Sources of recipes should be verified and reliable

- Robust data protection measures
- Regular updates and quality assurance processes

### 3.3 FSA Recommendations for Digital Platforms (2025 Update)

In **March 2025**, the Food Standards Agency released updated recommendations that explicitly address digital platforms:

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Written Allergen Information**
   - Apps and online platforms should provide written allergen information (not just verbal)
   - Information should be accessible before purchase or consumption decisions

2. **Digital-First Approach**
   - Apps or online platforms that allow customers to quickly access allergen information are recommended
   - Many consumers prefer to check allergen details online before making dining decisions

3. **Clarity and Consistency**
   - Allergen information should be clear, comprehensive, and accurate
   - Information must be easily available in writing to ensure accuracy and consistency

4. **Distance Selling (if applicable)**
   - If food is sold online, allergen information must be provided:
     - Before the purchase is completed
     - When the food is delivered

### 3.4 Best Practices for Allergen Information Collection

Based on research into successful food allergy apps and FSA guidance, here are best practices for collecting allergen information during user onboarding:

#### User Profile Customization

**What to Collect:**
- Selection of all 14 major allergens that apply to the user

   - Packaged ingredients may contain hidden allergens
   - Manufacturers can change formulations without notice
   - Cross-contamination from shared manufacturing

2. **Cross-Contact Risks**
   - Shared cooking equipment
   - Airborne proteins during cooking (fish, shellfish)
   - Improper cleaning between dishes
   - Storage contamination

3. **Recipe Variations**
   - Recipes may not specify brand-name ingredients
   - Substitutions may introduce allergens
   - "Hidden" allergens in common ingredients

**Opportunities:**

1. **Complete Control**
   - Home cooks can verify every ingredient
   - Control over cleaning and preparation
   - Ability to create safe spaces for allergen-free cooking

2. **Customization**
   - Easier to substitute allergens
   - Adapt recipes to individual needs
   - Create family-safe versions

3. **Education**
   - Learn about allergen sources
   - Develop safe cooking practices
   - Build confidence in managing allergies

### 6.2 Cross-Contamination in Home Kitchens

**Critical Understanding:**
According to allergy organizations, **even tiny amounts of food protein can cause reactions in people with food allergies, and importantly, cooking does not reduce or eliminate the chances of a person with a food allergy having a reaction**.

**Prevention Strategies Our App Should Educate Users About:**

1. **Preparation Order**
   - Prepare allergen-free food first
   - Avoid cooking items side-by-side (risk of splattering)
   - Don't pick allergens out of food (proteins remain)

2. **Equipment and Surfaces**
   - Clean all surfaces with hot, soapy water before and after
   - Designate specific utensils and cutting boards for allergen-free cooking
   - Label and store designated equipment separately
   - Hand sanitizer is NOT sufficient - must use soap and water

3. **Storage**
   - Place allergen-containing foods on lower shelves
   - Store allergen-free foods above to prevent dripping
   - Individually wrap and seal foods
   - Use separate containers

4. **Cooking Methods**
   - Don't share fryers, grills, or baking sheets
   - Use fresh oil for allergen-free frying
   - Cover allergen-free foods when cooking nearby allergens
   - Be aware of airborne proteins (shellfish, fish steam)

5. **Condiments and Shared Items**
   - Use squeeze bottles to prevent cross-contact
   - Avoid "double-dipping" utensils
   - Keep separate jars of common condiments if needed

6. **Cleaning**
   - Sponges and towels can harbor allergens - use disposable when possible
   - Change dishcloths frequently
   - Run dishwasher on hot cycle
   - Clean can openers and other overlooked items

## Conclusion

Natasha's Law represents a landmark moment in UK food safety regulation, born from tragedy but creating lasting change to protect consumers with food allergies. For our recipe application, while we are not directly regulated under Natasha's Law (which applies to PPDS foods), we have a clear **duty of care** to provide accurate allergen information and help users make safe choices.

### Key Takeaways for Implementation:

1. **The 14 major allergens are non-negotiable** - Our app must account for all 14, with clear, comprehensive information

2. **Transparency builds trust** - Clear disclaimers, honest about limitations, and responsive to errors

3. **Education empowers users** - Providing not just filtering, but knowledge about allergens, cross-contamination, and safe cooking practices

4. **Data protection is paramount** - Allergen information is health data requiring explicit consent and robust security

5. **Quality assurance is ongoing** - Regular verification, error reporting mechanisms, and continuous improvement

6. **User safety comes first** - Emergency guidance, cross-contamination warnings, and encouragement to verify independently

### The Human Impact:

Behind the regulations and best practices are real people like Natasha Ednan-Laperouse and Owen Carey, whose tragic deaths prompted legislative change. An estimated **2.4 million UK adults live with food allergies**, and approximately **10 people die annually** from food-induced anaphylaxis due to undeclared allergens.

Our app has the potential to make a genuine difference in the lives of these users - helping them discover safe recipes, cook with confidence, and enjoy food without fear. By implementing comprehensive allergen management with transparency, education, and rigorous quality assurance, we can contribute to the broader mission of keeping people with food allergies safe.

### Next Steps:

1. **Review this research** with the development team
2. **Prioritize Phase 1 implementation** items from Section 5.1
3. **Consult legal counsel** on disclaimer language and liability considerations
4. **Engage with allergy charities** for potential partnerships or endorsements
5. **Develop detailed implementation plan** with timelines and responsibilities
6. **Conduct user research** with people managing food allergies to validate our approach

By approaching allergen management with the seriousness and care it deserves, we can build an app that not only complies with our duty of care, but genuinely helps users live healthier, safer, and more enjoyable lives with their dietary restrictions.
